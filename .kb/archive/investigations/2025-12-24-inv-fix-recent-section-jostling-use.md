D.E.K.N. Summary - 30-second handoff for fresh Claude

## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** Recent section uses volatile sort (updated_at) causing card jostling on SSE updates, while Active section already uses stable sort (spawned_at).

**Evidence:** Line 269 in +page.svelte passes `false` to sortAgents for Recent (volatile), line 268 passes `true` for Active (stable).

**Knowledge:** The sortAgents function already supports stable sorting via spawned_at; Recent section just needs to use it.

**Next:** Change sortedRecentAgents to use stable sort by passing `true` instead of `false`.

**Confidence:** Very High (95%) - Simple one-line fix, logic already exists

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Confidence: High (85%) - small sample size (5 sessions).

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

# Investigation: Fix Recent Section Jostling Use

**Question:** Why does the Recent section jostle cards when SSE updates arrive, while Active section stays stable?

**Started:** 2025-12-24
**Updated:** 2025-12-24
**Owner:** Agent
**Phase:** Complete
**Next Step:** None
**Status:** Complete
**Confidence:** Very High (95%+)

## Findings

### Finding 1: sortAgents function has stable sort parameter

**Evidence:** The `sortAgents(agentList, useStableSort)` function at line 189 takes a boolean parameter that controls whether to use `spawned_at` (stable, immutable) or `updated_at` (volatile) for sorting.

**Source:** `web/src/routes/+page.svelte:189-201`

**Significance:** The infrastructure for stable sorting already exists - Recent section just wasn't using it.

---

### Finding 2: Active uses stable sort, Recent uses volatile sort

**Evidence:** 
- Line 268: `sortedActiveAgents = sortAgents(..., true)` - uses stable sort
- Line 269: `sortedRecentAgents = sortAgents(..., false)` - uses volatile sort

**Source:** `web/src/routes/+page.svelte:268-269`

**Significance:** This is the direct cause of the jostling - every SSE update changes `updated_at`, causing Recent cards to reorder constantly.

## Confidence Assessment

**Current Confidence:** [Level] ([Percentage])

**Why this level?**

[Explanation of why you chose this confidence level - what evidence supports it, what's strong vs uncertain]

**What's certain:**

- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]

**What's uncertain:**

- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]

**What would increase confidence to [next level]:**

- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]

**Confidence levels guide:**
- **Very High (95%+):** Strong evidence, minimal uncertainty, unlikely to change
- **High (80-94%):** Solid evidence, minor uncertainties, confident to act
- **Medium (60-79%):** Reasonable evidence, notable gaps, validate before major commitment
- **Low (40-59%):** Limited evidence, high uncertainty, proceed with caution
- **Very Low (<40%):** Highly speculative, more investigation needed
