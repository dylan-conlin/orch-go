D.E.K.N. Summary - 30-second handoff for fresh Claude
Fill this at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.

## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** [What was discovered/answered - the key finding in one sentence]

**Evidence:** [Primary evidence that supports the conclusion - test results, observations]

**Knowledge:** [What was learned - insights, constraints, or decisions made]

**Next:** [Recommended action - close, implement, investigate further, or escalate]

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

# Investigation: Analyze Commits Between fb0af37f (Dec 27) and 344da9a7 (Jan 2)

**Question:** Which commits between fb0af37f and 344da9a7 contain valuable changes worth recovering? Focus on bug fixes, features not related to dashboard/status state machine, and improvements to spawn/complete/daemon logic.

**Started:** 2026-01-03
**Updated:** 2026-01-03
**Owner:** Investigation Agent
**Phase:** Investigating
**Next Step:** Categorize all 245 commits and identify cherry-pick candidates
**Status:** In Progress

<!-- Lineage (fill only when applicable) -->
**Extracted-From:** [Project/path of original artifact, if this was extracted from another project]
**Supersedes:** [Path to artifact this replaces, if applicable]
**Superseded-By:** [Path to artifact that replaced this, if applicable]

## Findings

### Finding 1: Commit range contains ~245 commits over 6 days

**Evidence:** `git log --oneline fb0af37f..344da9a7 | wc -l` = 245 commits from Dec 27 to Jan 2.

**Source:** Git log analysis

**Significance:** Extensive development period. Need systematic categorization to identify valuable changes vs. state-machine refactoring to exclude.

---

### Finding 2: Exclusion criteria - Dashboard/status state machine commits

**Evidence:** Identified commits explicitly related to dead/stalled/stale agent states:
- 5cd7de68 feat(dashboard): simplify agent states to actionable categories
- 803751b7 fix: clean up OpenCode sessions on completion and differentiate dead states
- 6f62bd8a fix(dashboard): separate working agents from dead/stalled in Active section
- 5ba15ce0 feat: orch status detects dead/orphaned sessions
- 792fc7a2 investigation: dead agents dashboard
- 4026cb69 feat(state): unify agent status determination between CLI and API
- d222bfaa Revert above unification (crisis response)
- 784c2703 Simplify dead session detection to 3-minute heartbeat

**Source:** `git log --oneline fb0af37f..344da9a7 | grep -iE 'dead|stall|stale|state'`

**Significance:** These commits are explicitly excluded per task requirements. They relate to the state machine work that was reverted.

---

### Finding 3: Initial categorization - Starting approach

**Evidence:** Will categorize commits into:
1. **INCLUDE** - Bug fixes, spawn/complete/daemon improvements, pure features
2. **EXCLUDE** - Dashboard state machine, dead/stalled agent detection
3. **INVESTIGATE** - Unclear, need more context

**Source:** Planned approach

**Significance:** Systematic approach to handle 245 commits efficiently

### Recommended Approach ⭐

**[Approach Name]** - [One sentence stating the recommended implementation]

**Why this approach:**
- [Key benefit 1 based on findings]
- [Key benefit 2 based on findings]
- [How this directly addresses investigation findings]

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- [What we're giving up or deferring]
- [Why that's acceptable given findings]

**Implementation sequence:**
1. [First step - why it's foundational]
2. [Second step - why it comes next]
3. [Third step - builds on previous]

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option B: [Alternative approach]**
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Why not recommended - reference findings]
- **When to use instead:** [Conditions where this might be better]

**Option C: [Alternative approach]**
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Why not recommended - reference findings]
- **When to use instead:** [Conditions where this might be better]

**Rationale for recommendation:** [Brief synthesis of why Option A beats alternatives given investigation findings]
