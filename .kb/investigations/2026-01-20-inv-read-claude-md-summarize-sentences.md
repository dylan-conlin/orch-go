D.E.K.N. Summary - 30-second handoff for fresh Claude
Fill this at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.

## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** The CLAUDE.md file documents the orch-go project architecture, dual spawn modes, key packages, and common commands for AI agent orchestration via OpenCode API.

**Evidence:** Read the 335-line CLAUDE.md file which contains detailed architecture overview, package descriptions, spawn flows, and command references.

**Knowledge:** The document serves as comprehensive project documentation covering system architecture, development guidelines, and operational commands for the Go rewrite of orch-cli.

**Next:** Close investigation - task completed as requested (read and summarize CLAUDE.md).

**Promote to Decision:** recommend-no (informational reading task, no architectural decisions)

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Promote to Decision: recommend-no (tactical fix, not architectural)

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Promote to Decision: flag for orchestrator/human - recommend-yes if this establishes a pattern, constraint, or architectural choice worth preserving
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

## Findings

### Finding 1: CLAUDE.md provides comprehensive project documentation

**Evidence:** The 335-line file contains sections on architecture overview, dual spawn modes, key packages, spawn flow, commands, development guidelines, and common gotchas.

**Source:** /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/CLAUDE.md:1-335

**Significance:** This serves as the primary documentation for the orch-go project, enabling developers to understand the system architecture and operational patterns.

---

### Finding 2: Key architectural principle: dual spawn modes for resilience

**Evidence:** The document describes primary path (OpenCode API + daemon) and escape hatch (Claude CLI + tmux) modes, with the principle that critical paths need independent secondary paths.

**Source:** /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/CLAUDE.md:61-102

**Significance:** This resilience pattern ensures the orchestration system can continue working even when core infrastructure components fail.

---

### Finding 3: Document includes practical operational guidance

**Evidence:** Contains command references, dashboard server management instructions, development workflows, and common gotchas with specific solutions.

**Source:** /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/CLAUDE.md:127-299

**Significance:** Provides actionable guidance for both development and daily operation of the orchestration system.
