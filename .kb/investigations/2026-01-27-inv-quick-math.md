D.E.K.N. Summary - 30-second handoff for fresh Claude
Fill this at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.

## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** 9 * 2 = 18 (verified through mathematical calculation and shell test)

**Evidence:** Arithmetic verification: 9 * 2 = 18. Tested via shell calculation: `echo "9 * 2" | bc` returns 18.

**Knowledge:** Basic multiplication is reliable and consistent.

**Next:** Close investigation - question answered.

**Promote to Decision:** recommend-no - Straightforward factual answer, no architectural or strategic implications.

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Promote to Decision: recommend-no (tactical fix, not architectural)

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Promote to Decision: flag for orchestrator/human - recommend-yes if this establishes a pattern, constraint, or architectural choice worth preserving
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

## Findings

### Finding 1: Mathematical Calculation of 9 * 2

**Evidence:** 9 * 2 = 18. This is fundamental multiplication from basic mathematics.

**Source:** Mathematical principle; verified via shell calculation: `echo "9 * 2" | bc` returns `18`

**Significance:** Answers the core question directly. The product of 9 and 2 is definitively 18.

---

## Synthesis

**Key Insights:**

1. **Arithmetic is deterministic** - Basic addition yields consistent, verifiable results. 2 + 2 always equals 4.

**Answer to Investigation Question:**

The answer to "What is 2 + 2?" is **4**. This is supported by fundamental mathematical principles and verified through computational calculation (bash: `echo "2 + 2" | bc` returns `4`). No gaps or limitations apply to this straightforward arithmetic operation.

---

## Structured Uncertainty

**What's tested:**

- ✅ Mathematical calculation: 2 + 2 = 4 (verified: basic arithmetic)
- ✅ Shell calculation: `echo "2 + 2" | bc` returns 4

**What's untested:**

- None - straightforward fact with no untested hypotheses

**What would change this:**

- Nothing would change this answer - it's a mathematical constant
