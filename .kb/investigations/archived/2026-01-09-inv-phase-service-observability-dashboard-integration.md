## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** Phase 1 service monitoring (crash detection) is complete; Phase 2 requires API endpoint, Svelte store, and dashboard UI components.

**Evidence:** pkg/service/monitor.go exists with GetState() method; service monitor already running in serve.go:208; event types defined in pkg/events/logger.go.

**Knowledge:** Can reuse existing orchestrator-sessions patterns for UI; monitor.GetState() returns map[string]ServiceState with all needed fields.

**Next:** Implement /api/services endpoint, create services.ts store, build service-card and services-section components, integrate into dashboard.

**Promote to Decision:** recommend-no - Tactical implementation following established patterns

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Promote to Decision: recommend-no (tactical fix, not architectural)

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Promote to Decision: flag for orchestrator/human - recommend-yes if this establishes a pattern, constraint, or architectural choice worth preserving
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

# Investigation: Phase Service Observability Dashboard Integration

**Question:** How to implement Phase 2 dashboard integration for service observability (API endpoint, Svelte store, UI components)?

## Findings

### Finding 1: Phase 1 Service Monitor Already Implemented

**Evidence:** ServiceMonitor type with Poll(), GetState(), auto-restart capability; Background goroutine started from serve.go:208; Event logging integrated via EventLoggerAdapter.

**Source:** pkg/service/monitor.go:36-296; cmd/orch/serve.go:208-210; pkg/service/event_adapter.go

**Significance:** Backend infrastructure complete for Phase 2; just need to expose via API endpoint and build UI.

---

### Finding 2: Established Pattern for Dashboard Sections

**Evidence:** Orchestrator-sessions section uses collapsible pattern with section + card components; Store pattern: fetch() method, writable store, SSE streaming optional.

**Source:** web/src/lib/components/orchestrator-sessions-section/; web/src/lib/stores/orchestrator-sessions.ts; web/src/routes/+page.svelte:68

**Significance:** Can replicate this pattern for services section - minimal implementation effort, consistent UX.

---

### Finding 3: Service Event Types Already Defined

**Evidence:** EventTypeServiceCrashed, EventTypeServiceRestarted, EventTypeServiceStarted in pkg/events/logger.go:30-34

**Source:** pkg/events/logger.go:29-34; pkg/service/event_adapter.go

**Significance:** Event logging infrastructure complete; Phase 3 SSE streaming will be straightforward extension.
