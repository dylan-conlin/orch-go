## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** Implemented `pkg/state/reconcile.go` with `IsLive(beadsID)` function that cross-references 4 state sources to detect phantom agents.

**Evidence:** All tests pass (TestIsLive, TestFindWorkspaceByBeadsID, TestLivenessResult); full test suite passes without regressions.

**Knowledge:** Agent liveness can be determined by checking OpenCode sessions, tmux windows, beads issues, and workspace directories - combining these reveals "phantom" agents (beads open but nothing running).

**Next:** Close issue; next step is integrating IsLive into `orch status` command.

**Confidence:** High (90%) - Unit tests pass, but integration tests would require mocking tmux/OpenCode.

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Confidence: High (85%) - small sample size (5 sessions).

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

## Confidence Assessment

**Current Confidence:** [Level] ([Percentage])

**Why this level?**

[Explanation of why you chose this confidence level - what evidence supports it, what's strong vs uncertain]

**What's certain:**

- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]
- ✅ [Thing you're confident about with supporting evidence]

**What's uncertain:**

- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]
- ⚠️ [Area of uncertainty or limitation]

**What would increase confidence to [next level]:**

- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]
- [Specific additional investigation or evidence needed]

**Confidence levels guide:**
- **Very High (95%+):** Strong evidence, minimal uncertainty, unlikely to change
- **High (80-94%):** Solid evidence, minor uncertainties, confident to act
- **Medium (60-79%):** Reasonable evidence, notable gaps, validate before major commitment
- **Low (40-59%):** Limited evidence, high uncertainty, proceed with caution
- **Very Low (<40%):** Highly speculative, more investigation needed
