D.E.K.N. Summary - 30-second handoff for fresh Claude
Fill this at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.

## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** [What was discovered/answered - the key finding in one sentence]

**Evidence:** [Primary evidence that supports the conclusion - test results, observations]

**Knowledge:** [What was learned - insights, constraints, or decisions made]

**Next:** [Recommended action - close, implement, investigate further, or escalate]

**Promote to Decision:** [recommend-yes | recommend-no | unclear] - Orchestrator/human decides; worker flags

<!--
Example D.E.K.N.:
Delta: Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts and CLAUDE.md.
Evidence: Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests; guidance exists in separate docs but isn't loaded.
Knowledge: Agents follow documentation literally; guidance must be in loaded context to be followed.
Next: Add test-running instruction to SPAWN_CONTEXT.md template.
Promote to Decision: recommend-no (tactical fix, not architectural)

Guidelines:
- Keep each line to ONE sentence
- Delta answers "What did we find?"
- Evidence answers "How do we know?"
- Knowledge answers "What does this mean?"
- Next answers "What should happen now?"
- Promote to Decision: flag for orchestrator/human - recommend-yes if this establishes a pattern, constraint, or architectural choice worth preserving
- Enable 30-second understanding for fresh Claude

## Structured Uncertainty

**What's tested:**

- ✅ [Claim with evidence of actual test performed - e.g., "API returns 200 (verified: ran curl command)"]
- ✅ [Claim with evidence of actual test performed]
- ✅ [Claim with evidence of actual test performed]

**What's untested:**

- ⚠️ [Hypothesis without validation - e.g., "Performance should improve (not benchmarked)"]
- ⚠️ [Hypothesis without validation]
- ⚠️ [Hypothesis without validation]

**What would change this:**

- [Falsifiability criteria - e.g., "Finding would be wrong if X produces different results"]
- [Falsifiability criteria]

## Implementation Recommendations

**Purpose:** Bridge from investigation findings to actionable implementation using directive guidance pattern (strong recommendations + visible reasoning).

### Recommended Approach ⭐

**[Approach Name]** - [One sentence stating the recommended implementation]

**Why this approach:**

- [Key benefit 2 based on findings]
- [How this directly addresses investigation findings]

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- [What we're giving up or deferring]
- [Why that's acceptable given findings]

**Implementation sequence:**
1. [First step - why it's foundational]
2. [Second step - why it comes next]
3. [Third step - builds on previous]

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Option B: [Alternative approach]**
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Why not recommended - reference findings]
- **When to use instead:** [Conditions where this might be better]

**Option C: [Alternative approach]**
- **Pros:** [Benefits]
- **Cons:** [Why not recommended - reference findings]
- **When to use instead:** [Conditions where this might be better]

**Rationale for recommendation:** [Brief synthesis of why Option A beats alternatives given investigation findings]
