# Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

## 1. Read Error Messages Carefully

- Don't skip past errors or warnings
- They often contain the exact solution
- Read stack traces completely
- Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

## 2. Reproduce Consistently

- Can you trigger it reliably?
- What are the exact steps?
- Does it happen every time?
- If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

## 3. Check Recent Changes AND Pattern Recognition

**Recent changes:**
- What changed that could cause this?
- Git diff, recent commits
- New dependencies, config changes
- Environmental differences

**Pattern recognition check (whack-a-mole detection):**
- Search git history for similar fixes:
  - `git log --all --grep="[issue-type]" --oneline` (e.g., "timeout", "null check", "race condition")
  - `git log --all --grep="[component-name]" --oneline` (e.g., "proxy", "modal", "login")
- Check commit messages/diffs for this issue type
- **If 2+ previous fixes of same TYPE found → Whack-a-mole pattern detected**

**Whack-a-mole indicators:**
- Same issue type fixed in different locations (proxy timeout, modal timeout, API timeout)
- Incrementally adjusting same variable type (bumping timeouts, adding null checks, increasing retries)
- Each fix works temporarily but similar issues appear elsewhere
- Pattern of "just increase this value" fixes

**If whack-a-mole pattern detected:**
1. **STOP fixing symptoms**
2. Investigate systemic cause:
   - Missing centralized configuration?
   - Missing validation layer?
   - Architectural issue (tight coupling, shared mutable state)?
   - Environment-specific behavior not accounted for (proxy latency, network conditions)?
3. Design systematic solution BEFORE implementing fix
4. Document pattern in workspace under "Root Cause Analysis"
5. Escalate to orchestrator for systemic design if needed (may spawn `architect -i`)

**Example from real session:**
- Immediate issue: Modal timeout (2s → 10s fix needed)
- Git history check: Found 4 previous timeout fixes (proxy: 60s→120s, various other timeouts increased)
- Pattern recognized: Hardcoded timeouts fail with residential proxies (2-4s unpredictable latency)
- Systemic solution: Centralized timeout config with proxy multiplier (prevents future timeout whack-a-mole)

## 4. Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems

**WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**

**BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
```
For EACH component boundary:
  - Log what data enters component
  - Log what data exits component
  - Verify environment/config propagation
  - Check state at each layer

Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
THEN investigate that specific component
```

**Example (multi-layer system):**
```bash
# Layer 1: Workflow
echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

# Layer 2: Build script
echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

# Layer 3: Signing script
echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
security list-keychains
security find-identity -v

# Layer 4: Actual signing
codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
```

**This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)

## 5. Layer Bias Anti-Pattern (Symptom Location ≠ Root Cause)

**CRITICAL:** Where symptoms appear is often NOT where root cause lives.

**Benchmark evidence (Jan 2026):** In a debugging task where admin logout didn't work:
- 4/6 AI models created frontend fixes (LoginPage.tsx, AdminLogin.tsx, etc.)
- Root cause was backend: missing `path="/"` in cookie operations
- Frontend was where symptom appeared; backend was where fix belonged

**Layer bias triggers:**
- UI shows wrong state → Check if state source (API/backend) is correct BEFORE touching UI
- Frontend behavior broken → Check if backend returns expected data FIRST
- Error visible in logs at layer N → Trace whether cause is at layer N-1

**Anti-pattern detection:**
- You're about to create a new frontend component to "handle" an auth issue
- You're adding UI workarounds for data that shouldn't be wrong
- You're fixing display logic when the displayed value is incorrect at source

**Countermeasure:** Before implementing frontend fix, verify:
1. Is backend returning correct data? (check API response)
2. Is state being set correctly at source? (check data flow)
3. Would fixing at source eliminate the need for frontend fix?

**Rule:** Fix at lowest layer that addresses root cause. UI fixes for backend bugs = symptom masking.

## 6. Trace Data Flow

**WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:root-cause-tracing for backward tracing technique

**Quick version:**
- Where does bad value originate?
- What called this with bad value?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

## 7. Security Impact Assessment

**Once you understand the bug, assess whether it has security implications:**

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Could a malicious actor exploit this bug? | Flag as security issue, escalate urgency |
| Does this expose user data or credentials? | Flag as security issue, note data scope |
| Does this bypass authentication or authorization? | Flag as security issue, escalate immediately |
| Could this enable injection (SQL, XSS, command)? | Flag as security issue, document attack vector |

**If security impact identified:**
1. `bd comments add <beads-id> "SECURITY: [vulnerability type] - [brief description of exposure]"`
2. Continue fixing (don't wait) — but the escalation ensures visibility
3. Note security impact in completion comment for orchestrator review

**If no security impact:** Proceed normally.

**Why this matters:** Debugging agents finding "user input passed directly to SQL query" should flag it as a security vulnerability, not just fix it as a regular bug. The fix is the same — the urgency and tracking are different.

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

You understand:
- **WHAT** is broken (specific component, function, data)
- **WHY** it's broken (root cause, not symptom)
- **WHERE** the problem originates (source of bad data/state)

If you can't answer all three, continue investigating. Don't proceed to Phase 2.
