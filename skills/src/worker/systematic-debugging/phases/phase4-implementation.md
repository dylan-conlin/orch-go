# Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

## 1. Create Failing Test Case

- Simplest possible reproduction
- Automated test if possible
- One-off test script if no framework
- MUST have before fixing
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:test-driven-development for writing proper failing tests

## 2. Implement Single Fix

- Address the root cause identified
- ONE change at a time
- No "while I'm here" improvements
- No bundled refactoring

## 3. Verify Fix

- Test passes now?
- No other tests broken?
- Issue actually resolved?

## 4. If Fix Doesn't Work

- STOP
- Count: How many fixes have you tried?
- If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
- **If ≥ 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
- DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

## 5. If 3+ Fixes Failed OR Whack-a-Mole Pattern Detected: Question Architecture

**Triggers for architectural discussion:**
- **3+ fix attempts in current session failed**
- **OR: 2+ similar fixes found in git history (whack-a-mole pattern from Phase 1)**
- Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
- Same TYPE of issue keeps appearing (timeouts, null checks, race conditions)
- Each fix works locally but similar issues appear in different components
- Incremental parameter adjustments rather than root cause fixes
- "Just bump this value" becoming a recurring pattern

**STOP and question fundamentals:**
- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
- Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?
- Do we need centralized configuration/validation/infrastructure instead of scattered fixes?

**Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture or missing infrastructure.

**Example systemic solutions:**
- Centralized configuration (timeout management, retry policies)
- Validation layers (defense in depth, fail-fast at boundaries)
- Architectural refactoring (remove tight coupling, eliminate shared mutable state)
- Infrastructure improvements (better error handling, observability, adaptive behavior)

## Common Rationalizations (All Wrong)

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Success Criteria for Phase 4

- Failing test created and verified to fail
- Single fix implemented addressing root cause
- Test now passes
- No other tests broken
- Issue actually resolved (not just symptoms masked)
