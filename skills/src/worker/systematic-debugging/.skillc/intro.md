# Systematic Debugging

## Summary

Four-phase debugging framework: Root Cause → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation. Core principle: understand before fixing.

---

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

---

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, production bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- Previous fixes didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

---

## Quick Reference

1. Check if specialized technique applies (see patterns section)
2. Check console/logs for errors - error may already be captured
3. Phase 1: Root cause investigation (understand WHAT and WHY)
4. Phase 2: Pattern analysis (working vs broken differences)
5. Phase 3: Hypothesis testing (form and test specific theory)
6. Phase 4: Implementation (failing test, fix root cause, verify)
7. Document and complete

**Red flag:** If thinking "quick fix for now" → STOP, return to Phase 1.
