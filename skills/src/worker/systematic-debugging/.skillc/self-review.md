## Self-Review (Mandatory)

After implementing fix, perform self-review before completion.

### Pattern Scope Verification

**If bug was a pattern that could exist elsewhere:**

```bash
# Check for pattern occurrences
rg "bug_pattern"                    # Should be 0 or documented exceptions
rg "range\(len\(" --type py         # Off-by-one example
rg "timeout.*=.*[0-9]" --type py    # Hardcoded timeout example
```

**Skip if:** Bug was truly one-off (typo, unique logic error).

### Debugging-Specific Checks

| Check | If Failed |
|-------|-----------|
| Root cause addressed (not symptom) | Return to Phase 1 |
| No debug code left (console.log, print) | Remove before commit |
| No temporary workarounds ("TODO: fix properly") | Complete the fix |
| Regression test exists | Add test |
| Investigation documented | Update file |

### Standard Checks

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Conventional commit format (`fix:`, `test:`)
- [ ] Atomic commits

### Discovered Work

If you found related bugs, tech debt, or strategic unknowns:

```bash
bd create "description" --type bug    # or --type task
bd create "description" --type question # for architectural/premise questions
bd label <id> triage:review           # default label for review
```

**Note "No discovered work" in completion if nothing found.**

### Report via Beads

```bash
# If issues found and fixed:
bd comments add <beads-id> "Self-review: Fixed [issue summary]"

# If passed:
bd comments add <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"
```
