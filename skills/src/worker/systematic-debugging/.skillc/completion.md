## Completion Criteria

Before marking complete, verify ALL:

- [ ] **Root cause identified** - Documented in investigation OR commit message
- [ ] **Fix implemented** - Addresses root cause, not symptoms
- [ ] **Tests passing** - Including reproduction test, with **actual test output documented**
- [ ] **Smoke-test passed** - Actual failing scenario now works
- [ ] **Self-review passed** - Pattern scope, no debug code, no workarounds
- [ ] **Discovered work reviewed** - Tracked or noted "No discoveries"
- [ ] **Phase reported with test evidence** - `bd comments add <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Tests: <cmd> - <output>"` (BEFORE final commit)
- [ ] **Git clean** - `git status` shows "nothing to commit"

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

### After All Criteria Met (in this EXACT order)

```bash
# 1. Report phase FIRST (before commit) - prevents agent death race condition
# Include ACTUAL test output, not just "tests passing"
bd comments add <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Root cause: [X], Fix: [Y], Tests: go test ./... - 23 passed, 0 failed"

# 2. Commit any final changes
git add <files> && git commit -m "fix: [description]"

# 3. Session complete — no further actions needed.
```

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
- Format: `Tests: <command> - <actual output summary>`
- Good: `Tests: go test ./... - 23 passed, 0 failed`
- Good: `Tests: npm test - 15 specs, 0 failures`
- Bad: `Tests passing` (no command, no numbers)

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in comments. Vague claims trigger manual verification.

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility.

## Fast-Path Alternative

For clearly localized, trivial failures (import path error, undefined name, obvious single-file fix):

Use `quick-debugging` skill instead. It provides lightweight loop with strict escalation back to systematic-debugging if first attempt fails.

**Use quick-debugging when:**
- Scope ≤ 2 files and ≤ 1 hour
- Error points directly at fix location
- No architectural uncertainty

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question architecture, return to Phase 1.
