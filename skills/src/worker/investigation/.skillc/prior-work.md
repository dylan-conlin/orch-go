## Prior Work (Template Independence)

**Applies to Investigation Mode only.** In Probe Mode, use the probe template and skip the Prior-Work table.

**Why this matters:** 701 existing investigations lack the Prior-Work table. The skill must handle both old and new investigations gracefully.

### Creating New Investigations

When creating a new investigation via `kb create investigation`, your file MUST include a Prior-Work table:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation   | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts     |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| [path or "N/A"] | [type]       | [yes/no] | [description] |

**Relationship types:** extends, confirms, contradicts, deepens
```

**If no prior investigations exist:** Use explicit acknowledgment:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation             | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| N/A - novel investigation | -            | -        | -         |
```

### Extending Old Investigations (Graceful Degradation)

If SPAWN_CONTEXT references prior investigations that lack Prior-Work tables:

1. **Do NOT backfill old investigations** - Never modify their structure
2. **Create a new investigation file** with full Prior-Work table
3. **Reference the old investigation** in your Prior-Work table:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation                                  | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| .kb/investigations/2025-11-15-inv-old-topic.md | extends      | yes      | [describe any conflicts with prior claims] |
```

**Verification happens naturally:** As you explore, you'll encounter claims from prior investigations. Verify them against primary sources (code, test output) when relevant to your question - not all upfront.

### Key Rules

| Situation                       | Action                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| New investigation (no priors)   | Add Prior-Work table with "N/A - novel investigation"     |
| New investigation (has priors)  | Add Prior-Work table, cite prior investigations           |
| Extending old investigation     | Create NEW file with Prior-Work table referencing the old |
| Old investigation without table | Leave it alone, don't modify                              |
