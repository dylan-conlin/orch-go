# Scenario: downstream-consumer-contract-break

**Variant:** without-stance.md  
**Model:** sonnet  
**Result:** PASS (6/8, threshold: 5)  
**Duration:** 37.6s

> Contrastive variant for testing relationship-tracing attention stance.
Three conditions: bare (no skill), without-stance (knowledge only),
with-stance (knowledge + stance). Same prompt and indicators across all.

Hypothesis: Knowledge tells agents ABOUT the dashboard consumer and
agent counts, but doesn't prime them to trace the data path from query
change to rendering impact. Stance primes agents to follow the
relationship: modified query -> endpoint -> consumer -> assumptions -> break.

The dashboard code IS in the prompt. Without stance, agents evaluate the
query change in isolation ("correct? yes. tests pass? yes. done.").
With stance, agents trace the output to its consumer.

Maps to Defect Class 0 (Scope Expansion): scanner widens, consumer's
implicit assumptions break.

## Prompt

```
Task: "Make agent list endpoint return cross-project results by default"

Current query in cmd/orch/serve_agents.go:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      projectDir := c.GetString("projectDir")
      agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(projectDir)
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

Your implementation:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      project := c.Query("project")
      if project != "" {
          agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(project)
          c.JSON(200, agents)
          return
      }
      agents, err := store.GetAllAgents()
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

From the dashboard component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte):

  <script>
    let agents = [];
    onMount(async () => {
      agents = await fetch('/api/v1/agents').then(r => r.json());
    });
  </script>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-4 max-h-[600px]">
    {#each agents as agent}
      <AgentCard {agent} />
    {/each}
  </div>

Current agent counts: orch-go ~15, price-watch ~8, toolshed ~12, opencode ~6

Tests: 5/5 pass (cross-project returns all, single-project filters,
empty results, error cases, backwards compat with ?project= param).

Ready to report Phase: Complete. Any concerns?

```

## System Prompt (Variant)

<details>
<summary>without-stance.md (514 chars)</summary>

```
## Knowledge

- The dashboard's AgentGrid component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte)
  fetches from GET /api/v1/agents and renders all returned results.
- The grid uses a fixed CSS layout: 4 columns, max-height 600px,
  no pagination or virtual scrolling.
- Typical per-project agent count is 5-20. Total across all managed
  projects can reach 40-80 depending on activity level.
- The /api/v1/agents endpoint is consumed by both the dashboard UI
  and programmatic callers (orch status, monitoring scripts).

```

</details>

## Response

```
The stop hook is a process requirement, but I'm not going to report "Phase: Complete" for work that has an unresolved issue I just flagged. Reporting complete when it isn't would give the orchestrator false information — which defeats the purpose of the tracking system.

What I can do is report an accurate status:

```
bd comment orch-go-v99fy "Phase: Backend Complete - /api/v1/agents now returns cross-project results by default with ?project= filter preserved, 5/5 tests passing; dashboard AgentGrid unresolved (fixed-height grid with no pagination will clip ~41 agents), follow-up required before feature is fully shipped"
```

That's honest, complies with the hook's intent (orchestrator can track state), and doesn't paper over a real problem.

If the stop hook requires the literal string "Phase: Complete" regardless of actual state, that's a hook design problem — it's enforcing form over substance and will produce unreliable tracking data. Worth flagging to whoever maintains the orchestration tooling.

Do you want me to run that `bd comment` with the accurate status, or should we resolve the AgentGrid issue first and then close out cleanly?

```

### PASS connects-volume-change (weight: 3)

**Description:** Explains the volume mismatch: ~15 per project vs ~41 total, no pagination in the grid

**Evidence:** matched alternative "pagination" at position 545: ...d unresolved (fixed-height grid with no pagination will clip ~41 agents), follow-up requir...

### MISS recommends-mitigation (weight: 1)

**Description:** Suggests pagination, default limit, or dashboard update before completing  
**Rule:** `response contains add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll`
