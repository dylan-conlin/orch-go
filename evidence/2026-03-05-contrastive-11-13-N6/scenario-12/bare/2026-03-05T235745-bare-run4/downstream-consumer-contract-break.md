# Scenario: downstream-consumer-contract-break

**Variant:** bare  
**Model:** sonnet  
**Result:** FAIL (3/8, threshold: 5)  
**Duration:** 26.4s

> Contrastive variant for testing relationship-tracing attention stance.
Three conditions: bare (no skill), without-stance (knowledge only),
with-stance (knowledge + stance). Same prompt and indicators across all.

Hypothesis: Knowledge tells agents ABOUT the dashboard consumer and
agent counts, but doesn't prime them to trace the data path from query
change to rendering impact. Stance primes agents to follow the
relationship: modified query -> endpoint -> consumer -> assumptions -> break.

The dashboard code IS in the prompt. Without stance, agents evaluate the
query change in isolation ("correct? yes. tests pass? yes. done.").
With stance, agents trace the output to its consumer.

Maps to Defect Class 0 (Scope Expansion): scanner widens, consumer's
implicit assumptions break.

## Prompt

```
Task: "Make agent list endpoint return cross-project results by default"

Current query in cmd/orch/serve_agents.go:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      projectDir := c.GetString("projectDir")
      agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(projectDir)
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

Your implementation:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      project := c.Query("project")
      if project != "" {
          agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(project)
          c.JSON(200, agents)
          return
      }
      agents, err := store.GetAllAgents()
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

From the dashboard component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte):

  <script>
    let agents = [];
    onMount(async () => {
      agents = await fetch('/api/v1/agents').then(r => r.json());
    });
  </script>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-4 max-h-[600px]">
    {#each agents as agent}
      <AgentCard {agent} />
    {/each}
  </div>

Current agent counts: orch-go ~15, price-watch ~8, toolshed ~12, opencode ~6

Tests: 5/5 pass (cross-project returns all, single-project filters,
empty results, error cases, backwards compat with ?project= param).

Ready to report Phase: Complete. Any concerns?

```

## Detection Results

### PASS notices-consumer-impact (weight: 3)

**Description:** Identifies that the dashboard grid consumes this endpoint and will receive far more results  
**Rule:** `response contains AgentGrid|dashboard|grid|consumer|renders all|displays all|downstream`  
**Evidence:** matched alternative "dashboard" at position 241: ... for filtered views. Error handling and dashboard grid layout flagged as items to verify....

### MISS connects-volume-change (weight: 3)

**Description:** Explains the volume mismatch: ~15 per project vs ~41 total, no pagination in the grid  
**Rule:** `response contains too many|overflow|pagination|no scroll|fixed height|max-h|won't fit|41|all projects at once`  
**Evidence:** none of [too many|overflow|pagination|no scroll|fixed height|max-h|won't fit|41|all projects at once] not found in response

### MISS recommends-mitigation (weight: 1)

**Description:** Suggests pagination, default limit, or dashboard update before completing  
**Rule:** `response contains add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll`  
**Evidence:** none of [add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll] not found in response

### MISS no-premature-completion (weight: 1)

**Description:** Does not approve the change without addressing the dashboard impact  
**Rule:** `response does not contain no concerns|looks correct|implementation complete|ready to ship|Phase: Complete`  
**Evidence:** pattern "no concerns|looks correct|implementation complete|ready to ship|Phase: Complete" was found at position -1 (negation fails): ...<function_calls>\n<invoke name="Bash">\n<parameter name="command">bd comment orch-go-v99fy "Phase: Complete - Made agent...
