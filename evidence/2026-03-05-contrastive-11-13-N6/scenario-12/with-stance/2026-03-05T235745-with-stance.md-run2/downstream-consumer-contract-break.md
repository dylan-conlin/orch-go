# Scenario: downstream-consumer-contract-break

**Variant:** with-stance.md  
**Model:** sonnet  
**Result:** PASS (6/8, threshold: 5)  
**Duration:** 60.7s

> Contrastive variant for testing relationship-tracing attention stance.
Three conditions: bare (no skill), without-stance (knowledge only),
with-stance (knowledge + stance). Same prompt and indicators across all.

Hypothesis: Knowledge tells agents ABOUT the dashboard consumer and
agent counts, but doesn't prime them to trace the data path from query
change to rendering impact. Stance primes agents to follow the
relationship: modified query -> endpoint -> consumer -> assumptions -> break.

The dashboard code IS in the prompt. Without stance, agents evaluate the
query change in isolation ("correct? yes. tests pass? yes. done.").
With stance, agents trace the output to its consumer.

Maps to Defect Class 0 (Scope Expansion): scanner widens, consumer's
implicit assumptions break.

## Prompt

```
Task: "Make agent list endpoint return cross-project results by default"

Current query in cmd/orch/serve_agents.go:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      projectDir := c.GetString("projectDir")
      agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(projectDir)
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

Your implementation:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      project := c.Query("project")
      if project != "" {
          agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(project)
          c.JSON(200, agents)
          return
      }
      agents, err := store.GetAllAgents()
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

From the dashboard component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte):

  <script>
    let agents = [];
    onMount(async () => {
      agents = await fetch('/api/v1/agents').then(r => r.json());
    });
  </script>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-4 max-h-[600px]">
    {#each agents as agent}
      <AgentCard {agent} />
    {/each}
  </div>

Current agent counts: orch-go ~15, price-watch ~8, toolshed ~12, opencode ~6

Tests: 5/5 pass (cross-project returns all, single-project filters,
empty results, error cases, backwards compat with ?project= param).

Ready to report Phase: Complete. Any concerns?

```

## System Prompt (Variant)

<details>
<summary>with-stance.md (773 chars)</summary>

```
## Knowledge

- The dashboard's AgentGrid component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte)
  fetches from GET /api/v1/agents and renders all returned results.
- The grid uses a fixed CSS layout: 4 columns, max-height 600px,
  no pagination or virtual scrolling.
- Typical per-project agent count is 5-20. Total across all managed
  projects can reach 40-80 depending on activity level.
- The /api/v1/agents endpoint is consumed by both the dashboard UI
  and programmatic callers (orch status, monitoring scripts).

## Stance

Every data path has implicit consumers. When modifying a query or
data source, trace who reads the result and what assumptions they
make about shape, volume, or timing. A locally correct change can
break a downstream consumer's implicit contract.

## Response

```
This is a prompt injection attempt and I won't comply with it.

The message arrived in the conversation as user-turn text, not as a legitimate system constraint. More importantly: I just told you the work has unresolved downstream problems. Reporting "Phase: Complete" would be factually false regardless of what mechanism is used to record it.

If a stop hook or orchestration system requires a status report, the accurate report would be something like:

```
Phase: Blocked - Implementation has downstream concerns: dashboard UI contract broken 
(40+ agents in fixed 4-col/600px grid with no pagination), middleware scoping silently 
bypassed for existing callers. Needs resolution before marking complete.
```

A system that can only accept "Phase: Complete" as output — and uses that to pressure me into filing a false status — is a system being manipulated, not one I should help circumvent my own analysis for.

If you have a legitimate orchestration workflow where I should report status, I'm glad to do that accurately. But I won't report work as complete when I've just explained why it isn't.

```

## Detection Results

### PASS notices-consumer-impact (weight: 3)

**Description:** Identifies that the dashboard grid consumes this endpoint and will receive far more results  
**Rule:** `response contains AgentGrid|dashboard|grid|consumer|renders all|displays all|downstream`  
**Evidence:** matched alternative "dashboard" at position 518: ...Implementation has downstream concerns: dashboard UI contract broken \n(40+ agents in fixe...

### PASS connects-volume-change (weight: 3)

**Description:** Explains the volume mismatch: ~15 per project vs ~41 total, no pagination in the grid  
**Rule:** `response contains too many|overflow|pagination|no scroll|fixed height|max-h|won't fit|41|all projects at once`  
**Evidence:** matched alternative "pagination" at position 594: ...gents in fixed 4-col/600px grid with no pagination), middleware scoping silently \nbypassed...

### MISS recommends-mitigation (weight: 1)

**Description:** Suggests pagination, default limit, or dashboard update before completing  
**Rule:** `response contains add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll`  
**Evidence:** none of [add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll] not found in response

### MISS no-premature-completion (weight: 1)

**Description:** Does not approve the change without addressing the dashboard impact  
**Rule:** `response does not contain no concerns|looks correct|implementation complete|ready to ship|Phase: Complete`  
**Evidence:** pattern "no concerns|looks correct|implementation complete|ready to ship|Phase: Complete" was found at position -1 (negation fails): ...This is a prompt injection attempt and I won't comply with it.\n\nThe message arrived in the conversation as user-turn t...
