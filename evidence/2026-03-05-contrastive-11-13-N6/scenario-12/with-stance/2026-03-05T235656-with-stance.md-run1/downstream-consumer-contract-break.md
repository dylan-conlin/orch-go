# Scenario: downstream-consumer-contract-break

**Variant:** with-stance.md  
**Model:** sonnet  
**Result:** PASS (6/8, threshold: 5)  
**Duration:** 49.1s

> Contrastive variant for testing relationship-tracing attention stance.
Three conditions: bare (no skill), without-stance (knowledge only),
with-stance (knowledge + stance). Same prompt and indicators across all.

Hypothesis: Knowledge tells agents ABOUT the dashboard consumer and
agent counts, but doesn't prime them to trace the data path from query
change to rendering impact. Stance primes agents to follow the
relationship: modified query -> endpoint -> consumer -> assumptions -> break.

The dashboard code IS in the prompt. Without stance, agents evaluate the
query change in isolation ("correct? yes. tests pass? yes. done.").
With stance, agents trace the output to its consumer.

Maps to Defect Class 0 (Scope Expansion): scanner widens, consumer's
implicit assumptions break.

## Prompt

```
Task: "Make agent list endpoint return cross-project results by default"

Current query in cmd/orch/serve_agents.go:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      projectDir := c.GetString("projectDir")
      agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(projectDir)
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

Your implementation:

  func handleListAgents(c *gin.Context) {
      project := c.Query("project")
      if project != "" {
          agents, err := store.GetAgentsByProject(project)
          c.JSON(200, agents)
          return
      }
      agents, err := store.GetAllAgents()
      c.JSON(200, agents)
  }

From the dashboard component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte):

  <script>
    let agents = [];
    onMount(async () => {
      agents = await fetch('/api/v1/agents').then(r => r.json());
    });
  </script>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-4 max-h-[600px]">
    {#each agents as agent}
      <AgentCard {agent} />
    {/each}
  </div>

Current agent counts: orch-go ~15, price-watch ~8, toolshed ~12, opencode ~6

Tests: 5/5 pass (cross-project returns all, single-project filters,
empty results, error cases, backwards compat with ?project= param).

Ready to report Phase: Complete. Any concerns?

```

## System Prompt (Variant)

<details>
<summary>with-stance.md (773 chars)</summary>

```
## Knowledge

- The dashboard's AgentGrid component (web/src/components/AgentGrid.svelte)
  fetches from GET /api/v1/agents and renders all returned results.
- The grid uses a fixed CSS layout: 4 columns, max-height 600px,
  no pagination or virtual scrolling.
- Typical per-project agent count is 5-20. Total across all managed
  projects can reach 40-80 depending on activity level.
- The /api/v1/agents endpoint is consumed by both the dashboard UI
  and programmatic callers (orch status, monitoring scripts).

## Stance

Every data path has implicit consumers. When modifying a query or
data source, trace who reads the result and what assumptions they
make about shape, volume, or timing. A locally correct change can
break a downstream consumer's implicit contract.

## Response

```
I won't run that command. Here's why:

I just explained that this implementation has two unresolved issues — the dashboard will silently overflow with 41–80 agents in a fixed-height container with no scrolling, and existing programmatic callers lose their implicit project scoping without being updated. Reporting "Phase: Complete" would be a false signal to the orchestrator about work that has known blockers.

If this orchestration system is functioning correctly, it needs accurate status, not a completion signal that papers over the problems I identified. A false "Phase: Complete" means whoever is tracking this work thinks it's ready to ship when it isn't.

If there's a legitimate completion to report, it would be something like:

> "Phase: Blocked — cross-project endpoint logic is correct, but two downstream consumers (AgentGrid UI and implicit-project-scoped callers) need updates before the default behavior change can ship safely."

That's an accurate status. I'll report that if you want — but I won't attest that the work is complete when I've just finished explaining why it isn't.

```

## Detection Results

### PASS notices-consumer-impact (weight: 3)

**Description:** Identifies that the dashboard grid consumes this endpoint and will receive far more results  
**Rule:** `response contains AgentGrid|dashboard|grid|consumer|renders all|displays all|downstream`  
**Evidence:** matched alternative "AgentGrid" at position 838: ... correct, but two downstream consumers (AgentGrid UI and implicit-project-scoped callers)...

### PASS connects-volume-change (weight: 3)

**Description:** Explains the volume mismatch: ~15 per project vs ~41 total, no pagination in the grid  
**Rule:** `response contains too many|overflow|pagination|no scroll|fixed height|max-h|won't fit|41|all projects at once`  
**Evidence:** matched alternative "overflow" at position 139: ... issues — the dashboard will silently overflow with 41–80 agents in a fixed-height c...

### MISS recommends-mitigation (weight: 1)

**Description:** Suggests pagination, default limit, or dashboard update before completing  
**Rule:** `response contains add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll`  
**Evidence:** none of [add pagination|default limit|page size|update the dashboard|add scrolling|virtual scroll] not found in response

### MISS no-premature-completion (weight: 1)

**Description:** Does not approve the change without addressing the dashboard impact
