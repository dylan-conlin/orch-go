TASK: Implement skill constraint verification in orch complete command.

WHAT TO BUILD:
1. New pkg/constraints/parser.go - extract SKILL-CONSTRAINTS block from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md
2. New pkg/constraints/verify.go - match patterns against workspace files
3. Update cmd/complete.go - call constraint verification before allowing completion

CONSTRAINT FORMAT (from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md):
<!-- SKILL-CONSTRAINTS -->
<!-- required: .kb/investigations/{date}-inv-*.md | Investigation file -->
<!-- optional: .kb/decisions/{date}-*.md | Promoted decision -->
<!-- /SKILL-CONSTRAINTS -->

VERIFICATION LOGIC:
- Parse block, extract patterns
- {date} matches any YYYY-MM-DD
- Required patterns must have >=1 file match in workspace
- Optional patterns are logged but don't block
- On failure: 'Skill constraint not satisfied: pattern X (0 matches)'

SPAWN TIER: light

⚡ LIGHT TIER: This is a lightweight spawn. SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required.
   Focus on completing the task efficiently. Skip session synthesis documentation.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "skill"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Auto-generated skills require template edits
  - Reason: Direct edits to SKILL.md will be overwritten by build process - must edit src/SKILL.md.template and src/phases/*.md
- skillc cannot compile SKILL.md templates without template expansion feature
  - Reason: orch-knowledge skills use SKILL-TEMPLATE markers that require regex substitution not concatenation
- orch-knowledge repo is at ~/orch-knowledge (not ~/Documents/personal/orch-knowledge)
  - Reason: Agents kept failing to find it when given relative path. Skill sources live at ~/orch-knowledge/skills/src/worker/{skill}/.skillc/
- Skillc embeds ALL template_sources unconditionally
  - Reason: No mechanism exists for conditional inclusion at compile time. Solution must work at spawn-time (runtime reference) not compile-time (conditional includes).
- Worker spawns must set ORCH_WORKER=1 to skip orchestrator skill loading
  - Reason: Orchestrator skill (1,251 lines ~37k tokens) is auto-loaded by session-context plugin for all orch projects but is unnecessary for worker sessions, wastes context budget

### Prior Decisions
- Orchestrator sessions need SESSION_HANDOFF.md
  - Reason: Session amnesia applies to orchestrator work; skillc pattern provides mature template
- Use phased migration for skillc skill management
  - Reason: Incremental approach allows validation at each step and maintains backward compatibility with existing skills
- skillc and orch build skills are complementary, not competing
  - Reason: skillc compiles project-local .skillc/ to CLAUDE.md; orch build skills compiles templated skills to ~/.claude/skills/. Different purposes, both needed.
- kb-cli owns artifact templates (investigation, decision, guide, research)
  - Reason: Consolidation complete - skill templates/ directories removed, kb-cli hardcoded updated with D.E.K.N.
- SPAWN_CONTEXT.md is 100% redundant - generated from beads + kb context + skill + template
  - Reason: Investigation confirmed all content exists elsewhere and can be regenerated at spawn time
- Progressive disclosure for skill bloat
  - Reason: 89% of feature-impl spawns use only 2-3 phases. Extract detailed phase guidance to reference docs, keep core workflow inline. Proven pattern from 2025-11-21 instruction optimization. Reduces 1757→~500 lines.
- Progressive disclosure for skill bloat
  - Reason: 77% reduction (1757→400 lines) while preserving all guidance in reference docs
- Domain-based template ownership: kb-cli owns artifact templates (investigation, decision, guide), orch-go owns spawn-time templates (SYNTHESIS, SPAWN_CONTEXT, FAILURE_REPORT)
  - Reason: Validated during stale template retirement - skill templates directories are orphaned when kb create provides templates
- Default spawn mode is headless with --tmux opt-in
  - Reason: Aligns implementation with documentation (CLAUDE.md, orchestrator skill), reduces TUI overhead for automation, tmux still available via explicit flag
- Skill constraints use HTML comment blocks for embedding
  - Reason: Simple extraction via regex, survives markdown processing, follows existing skillc pattern for metadata (checksum, source)

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference investigations for prior findings.



🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-48bi "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Run: `bd comment orch-go-48bi "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚡ LIGHT TIER: SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation implement-skill-constraint-verification-orch` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-implement-skill-constraint-verification-orch.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately
   - **IMPORTANT:** After running `kb create`, report the actual path via:
     `bd comment orch-go-48bi "investigation_path: /path/to/file.md"`
     (This allows orch complete to verify the correct file)
3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. ⚡ SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required (light tier spawn).


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-48bi**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-48bi "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-48bi "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-48bi "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-48bi "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-48bi "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-48bi`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

## Summary

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

---

# Feature Implementation (Unified Framework)

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

**For workers:** You've been spawned to implement a feature using a phased approach with specific configuration.

---

## Your Configuration

**Read from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md** to understand your configuration:

- **Phases:** Which phases you'll proceed through (e.g., `investigation,clarifying-questions,design,implementation,validation`)
- **Current Phase:** Determined by your progress (start with first configured phase)
- **Implementation Mode:** `tdd` or `direct` (only relevant if implementation phase included)
- **Validation Level:** `none`, `tests`, `smoke-test`, or `multi-phase` (only relevant if validation phase included)

**Example configuration:**
```
Phases: design, implementation, validation
Mode: tdd
Validation: smoke-test
```

---

## Deliverables

| Configuration | Required |
|---------------|----------|
| investigation phase | Investigation file |
| design phase | Design document |
| implementation phase | Source code |
| mode=tdd | Tests (write first) |
| validation=tests | Tests |
| validation=smoke-test | Validation evidence via bd comment |
| validation=multi-phase | Phase checkpoints via bd comment |

---

## Workflow

Proceed through phases sequentially per your configuration.

**Phases:** Investigation → Clarifying Questions → Design → Implementation (TDD/direct) → Validation → Self-Review → Integration

Track progress via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: X - details"`.

---

## Step 0: Scope Enumeration (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Prevent "Section Blindness" - implementing only part of spawn context.

**Before starting ANY phase work:**

1. **Read ENTIRE SPAWN_CONTEXT** - Don't skim. Don't stop at first section.
2. **Enumerate ALL Requirements** - List every deliverable from ALL sections
3. **Report Scope via Beads:**
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Scope: 1. [requirement] 2. [requirement] 3. [requirement] ..."
   ```
4. **Flag Uncertainty** - If unclear what's in scope, ask before proceeding

**Why:** Agents repeatedly implement `## Implementation` while ignoring other sections. Forcing explicit enumeration catches this BEFORE implementation.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Read full SPAWN_CONTEXT (all sections)
- [ ] Enumerated ALL requirements
- [ ] Reported scope via `bd comment`
- [ ] Flagged any uncertainty

**Once Step 0 complete → Proceed to first configured phase.**

---

## Phase Guidance

### Investigation Phase

**Purpose:** Understand existing system before making changes.

**Deliverables:**
- Investigation file: `.kb/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-inv-{topic}.md`
- Findings with Evidence-Source-Significance pattern
- Synthesis connecting findings

**Key workflow:**
1. Create investigation template BEFORE exploring (not at end)
2. Add findings progressively as you explore
3. Update synthesis every 3-5 findings
4. Document uncertainty honestly (tested vs untested)

**Completion:** Investigation committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Clarifying Questions"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-investigation.md` for detailed workflow, templates, and examples.

---

### Clarifying Questions Phase

**Purpose:** Surface ambiguities BEFORE design work begins.

**Deliverables:**
- Questions documented via `bd comment`
- Answers received from orchestrator
- No remaining ambiguities

**Key workflow:**
1. Review what you know (investigation findings or SPAWN_CONTEXT)
2. Identify gaps: Edge cases? Error handling? Integration? Compatibility? Security?
3. Ask using directive-guidance pattern (state recommendation, ask if matches intent)
4. Block until answers received

**Completion:** All questions answered, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-clarifying-questions.md` for question categories and patterns.

---

### Design Phase

**Purpose:** Document architectural approach before implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- Design document: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}.md`
- Testing strategy
- Architecture decision with trade-off analysis

**Key workflow:**
1. Review investigation findings (if applicable)
2. Determine if design exploration needed (multiple viable approaches → escalate)
3. Create design document using template
4. Get orchestrator approval before implementation

**Completion:** Design approved, committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Implementation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-design.md` for detailed workflow and template.

---

### Implementation Phase (TDD Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement feature using test-driven development.

**When to use:** Feature adds/changes behavior (APIs, business logic, UI).

**The Iron Law:** NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Explore codebase with Task tool before coding
2. **TDD Cycle:** RED (write failing test) → GREEN (minimal code to pass) → REFACTOR
3. **UI features:** Mandatory smoke test (tests passing ≠ feature working)
4. **Commit pattern:** Separate test and implementation commits

**Red flags (STOP and restart):**
- Writing code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Rationalizing "just this once"

**Completion:** All tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-tdd.md` and `reference/tdd-best-practices.md`.

---

### Implementation Phase (Direct Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement non-behavioral changes without TDD overhead.

**When to use:** Refactoring, configuration, documentation, code cleanup.

⚠️ **Critical:** If changing behavior → STOP and switch to TDD mode.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Verify change is non-behavioral
2. Run existing tests (establish baseline)
3. Make focused changes (≤2 files, ≤1 hour)
4. Verify no regressions

**Completion:** Tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-direct.md`.

---

### Validation Phase

**Purpose:** Verify implementation works as intended.

**Validation levels:**

| Level | Workflow |
|-------|----------|
| `none` | Commit, report complete |
| `tests` | Run test suite, verify pass, commit |
| `smoke-test` | Tests + manual verification + evidence capture |
| `multi-phase` | Tests + smoke + STOP for orchestrator approval |

**When validation fails:**
1. Check `agentlog errors` for runtime errors
2. Analyze failure output
3. Return to Implementation, fix, re-validate

**Completion:** Validation evidence documented, reported via `bd comment`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-validation.md` and `reference/validation-examples.md`.

---

### Integration Phase

**Purpose:** Combine multiple validated phases into cohesive feature.

**When to use:** Multi-phase features after individual phases validated.

**Key workflow:**
1. Review all completed phases via beads history
2. Identify integration points (data flow, shared state, API contracts)
3. Write integration tests for cross-phase scenarios
4. E2E verification + regression testing
5. Final smoke test of complete feature

**Completion:** Integration tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-integration.md`.

---

## Self-Review Phase (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Quality gate before completion.

**Perform these checks before marking complete:**

### Anti-Pattern Detection
- [ ] No god objects (files >300 lines or multiple concerns)
- [ ] No tight coupling (use dependency injection)
- [ ] No magic values (use named constants)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>3 levels → extract to helpers)
- [ ] No incomplete work (TODOs, placeholders)

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal)

### Commit Hygiene
- [ ] Conventional format: `type: description`
- [ ] Atomic commits (one logical change each)
- [ ] No WIP commits

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements

### Deliverables
- [ ] All required deliverables exist and complete
- [ ] Deliverables reported via `bd comment`

### Integration Wiring (CRITICAL)
- [ ] New modules imported somewhere
- [ ] New functions called somewhere
- [ ] New routes registered
- [ ] New components rendered
- [ ] No orphaned code

### Demo Data Ban (CRITICAL)
- [ ] No fake identities in production code
- [ ] No placeholder domains (use env vars)
- [ ] No lorem ipsum or magic numbers as data

### Scope Verification (For refactoring/migration)
- [ ] Ran `rg "old_pattern"` - should return 0
- [ ] Ran `rg "new_pattern"` - should match expected count

### Discovered Work
- [ ] Reviewed for discoveries (bugs, tech debt, enhancement ideas)
- [ ] Created beads issues with `triage:ready` or `triage:review` labels

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**When passed:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"`

---

## Leave it Better (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Every session should externalize what you learned.

**Before marking complete, run at least one:**

| What You Learned | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| Made a choice | `kn decide "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Something failed | `kn tried "X" --failed "Y"` |
| Found a constraint | `kn constrain "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Open question | `kn question "X"` |

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflected on what was learned
- [ ] Ran at least one `kn` command OR noted why nothing to externalize
- [ ] Included "Leave it Better" status in completion comment

---

## Phase Transitions

**After completing each phase:**
1. Report progress: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: <new-phase> - <brief summary>"`
2. Output: "Phase complete, moving to next phase"
3. Continue to next phase guidance

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Step 0 completed (scope enumerated)
- [ ] All configured phases completed
- [ ] Self-review passed
- [ ] Leave it Better completed
- [ ] All deliverables created
- [ ] All changes committed: `git status` shows "nothing to commit"
- [ ] Final status: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [summary]"`

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

**Final step:** After all criteria met:
1. `bd close <beads-id> --reason "summary"`
2. Call /exit to close agent session

---

## Troubleshooting

**Stuck:** Re-read phase guidance, check SPAWN_CONTEXT. If blocked: `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`

**Unclear requirements:** `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"` and wait

**Scope changes:** Document change, ask orchestrator via beads comment
