TASK: Audit beads fork divergence from upstream. Questions to answer:

1. How many commits ahead/behind is our fork from steveyegge/beads?
2. What specific changes exist in our fork? (list commits with descriptions)
3. What has upstream added since we forked that we're missing?
4. Are there merge conflicts if we tried to sync?
5. What's the maintenance burden of the current fork?

Check ~/Documents/personal/beads for the fork. Compare against upstream.

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "audit beads fork"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- tmux fallback requires either current registry window ID OR beads ID in window name format [beads-id]
  - Reason: If both are stale/missing, fallback fails despite window existing
- tmux fallback requires either current registry window ID OR beads ID in window name format [beads-id]
  - Reason: Both paths needed for resilience; if both stale/missing, fallback fails despite window existing
- Tmux fallback requires at least one valid path: current registry window_id OR beads ID in window name format [beads-id]
  - Reason: Dual dependency failure causes fallback to fail even when window exists (discovered iteration 5, confirmed iteration 10)
- orch tail tmux fallback requires either current registry window ID OR beads ID in window name format [beads-id]
  - Reason: Dual-dependency failure causes fallback to fail when both are stale/missing
- Beads cross-repo contamination can create orphaned FK references
  - Reason: bd-* prefixed dependencies were found in orch-go database from separate beads repo
- Untracked spawns (--no-track) generate placeholder beads IDs that fail bd comment commands
  - Reason: Beads IDs like orch-go-untracked-* don't exist in database, causing bd comment to fail with 'issue not found' - this is expected behavior, not a bug

### Prior Decisions
- Registry updates must happen before beads close in orch complete
  - Reason: Prevents inconsistent state where beads shows closed but registry shows active
- Create new beads issue if provided ID is invalid
  - Reason: Protocol requires phase reporting; invalid ID blocks this. Creating a new issue allows compliance.
- VerifyCompletion relies on latest beads comment
  - Reason: Ensures current state is validated
- Three-tier temporal model (ephemeral/persistent/operational) organizes artifact placement
  - Reason: Artifacts live where their lifecycle dictates - session-bound to workspace, project-lifetime to kb, work-in-progress to beads
- Cross-project epics use Option A: epic in primary repo, ad-hoc spawns with --no-track in secondary repos, manual bd close with commit refs
  - Reason: Only working pattern today. Beads multi-repo hydration is read-only aggregation, bd repo commands are buggy.
- Beads OSS: Clean Slate over Fork
  - Reason: Local features (ai-help, health, tree) not used by orch ecosystem. Drop rather than maintain.
- Post-registry lifecycle uses 4 state sources: OpenCode sessions, tmux windows, beads issues, workspaces
  - Reason: Registry removed due to false positive completion detection; derived lookups replace central state
- orch complete auto-closes tmux window after successful verification
  - Reason: Complete means done - window goes away, beads closes, workspace remains. Prevents phantom accumulation (41 windows today). Debugging escape hatch: don't complete until ready to close.
- orch status shows PHASE and TASK columns from beads data
  - Reason: Makes output actionable - users can immediately see what each agent is doing
- Always use findWorkspaceByBeadsID() for beads ID to workspace lookups
  - Reason: Workspace names don't contain beads ID - the ID only exists in SPAWN_CONTEXT.md

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- Beads multi-repo config via bd repo add
- Beads local-features branch
- Deleting orphaned beads dependencies with bd-* prefix
- beads progress tracking for untracked agents

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.





📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚡ LIGHT TIER: SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation audit-beads-fork-divergence-upstream` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-audit-beads-fork-divergence-upstream.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. ⚡ SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required (light tier spawn).


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

## Summary

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

# Worker Base Patterns

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

**What this provides:**
- Authority delegation (what you can decide vs escalate)
- Beads progress tracking (how to report via bd comment)
- Phase reporting (how to signal transitions)
- Exit/completion protocol (how to properly end a session)

---

## Authority Delegation

**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

---

## Phase Reporting

**First 3 Actions (Critical):**
Within your first 3 tool calls, you MUST:
1. Report via `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

**Status Updates:**
Update Status: field in your workspace/investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed)

**Signal orchestrator when blocked:**
- Add `**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]` to workspace
- Add `**Status:** QUESTION - [question]` when needing input

---

## Session Complete Protocol

**When your work is done (all deliverables ready), complete in this EXACT order:**

{{if eq .Tier "light"}}
1. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
2. Commit any final changes
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

**Light Tier:** SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.
{{else}}
1. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
2. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created
3. Commit all changes (including SYNTHESIS.md)
4. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session
{{end}}

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility even if the agent dies before committing.

**Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.**
The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.

## Summary

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

# Investigation Skill

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

## The One Rule

**You cannot conclude without testing.**

If you didn't run a test, you don't get to fill the Conclusion section.

## Evidence Hierarchy

**Artifacts are claims, not evidence.**

- **Primary** (authoritative): Actual code, test output, observed behavior → This IS the evidence
- **Secondary** (claims to verify): Workspaces, investigations, decisions → Hypotheses to test

When an artifact says "X is not implemented," that's a hypothesis—search the codebase before concluding.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/examples.md` for evidence hierarchy examples and common failures.

## Workflow

1. **Create file:** `kb create investigation {slug}`
2. **IMMEDIATE CHECKPOINT:** Fill Question, add Finding 1 ("Starting approach"), commit immediately
3. **TEST-FIRST GATE:** "What's the simplest test I can run right now?" (60-second rule)
4. Try things, observe what happens (add findings progressively)
5. **Run a test to validate your hypothesis**
6. Fill conclusion only if you tested
7. Final commit

**Why checkpoint immediately?** Agents can die from API errors, context limits, or crashes. Without a checkpoint, no record of what was attempted.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/error-recovery.md` for handling fatal errors during exploration.

## D.E.K.N. Summary

**Every investigation file starts with a D.E.K.N. summary block.** Enables 30-second handoff to fresh Claude.

- **Delta:** What was discovered/answered
- **Evidence:** Primary evidence supporting conclusion
- **Knowledge:** What was learned (insights, constraints)
- **Next:** Recommended action

**Fill D.E.K.N. at the END, before marking Complete.**

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/examples.md` for D.E.K.N. examples.

## Template

Use `kb create investigation {slug}` to create. Required sections:
- **D.E.K.N. Summary** (Delta, Evidence, Knowledge, Next)
- **Question** and **Status**
- **Findings** (add progressively)
- **Test performed** (not "reviewed code" - actual test)
- **Conclusion** (only if you tested)

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/template.md` for full structure and `reference/examples.md` for common failures.

## When Not to Use

- **Fixing bugs** → Use `systematic-debugging`
- **Trivial questions** → Just answer them
- **Documentation** → Use `capture-knowledge`

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify investigation quality:

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] **Test is real** - Ran actual command/code, not just "reviewed"
- [ ] **Evidence concrete** - Specific outputs, not "it seems to work"
- [ ] **Conclusion factual** - Based on observed results, not inference
- [ ] **No speculation** - Removed "probably", "likely", "should" from conclusion
- [ ] **Question answered** - Investigation addresses the original question
- [ ] **File complete** - All sections filled (not "N/A" or "None")
- [ ] **D.E.K.N. filled** - Replaced placeholders in Summary section
- [ ] **Scope verified** - Ran `rg` to find all occurrences before concluding
- [ ] **NOT DONE claims verified** - If claiming incomplete, searched actual code

### Discovered Work

If you found bugs, tech debt, or enhancement ideas during investigation:
- Create beads issues: `bd create "description" --type bug|task|feature`
- Apply label: `bd label <id> triage:ready` or `triage:review`

**If no discoveries:** Note "No discovered work items" in completion comment.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/self-review-guide.md` for scope verification examples and discovered work procedures.

**Only proceed to commit after self-review passes.**

---

## Leave it Better (Mandatory)

**Before marking complete, externalize at least one piece of knowledge:**
- `kb quick decide "X" --reason "Y"` (made a choice)
- `kb quick tried "X" --failed "Y"` (something failed)
- `kb quick constrain "X" --reason "Y"` (found a constraint)
- `kb quick question "X"` (open question)

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment: "Leave it Better: Straightforward investigation, no new knowledge to externalize."

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/leave-it-better.md` for command examples.

---

## Completion

1. Self-review passed
2. Leave it Better completed (or noted why N/A)
3. D.E.K.N. summary filled (with **Promote to Decision** flag)
4. Report: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [conclusion summary]"` (FIRST - before commit)
5. Commit: `git add && git commit`
6. Exit: `/exit`

**Why report before commit?** If agent dies after commit but before reporting, orchestrator cannot detect completion.

---

**Remember:** Test before concluding.
