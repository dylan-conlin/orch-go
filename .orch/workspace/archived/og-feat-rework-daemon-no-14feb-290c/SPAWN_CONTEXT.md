TASK: Rework daemon: no auto-close, faster polling, review-queue model

Two changes to daemon behavior based on verifiability-first design session:

1. DAEMON NEVER AUTO-CLOSES ISSUES
Current: daemon polls for Phase:Complete, verifies artifacts, closes issue automatically.
New: daemon detects Phase:Complete, flags agent as 'ready for review', but does NOT close the issue. Dylan closes issues through the orchestrator after two-gate verification (comprehension + behavioral). Daemon pauses spawning when N agents are waiting for review (default 3) so work doesnt pile up unboundedly.

This means the daemon loop becomes:
  - Poll bd ready, spawn within capacity
  - Monitor for Phase:Complete
  - When agents complete, mark as ready-for-review (not closed)
  - Pause spawning when N agents waiting for review
  - Dylan reviews batch through orchestrator, closes each
  - Daemon sees capacity freed, spawns more

2. FASTER POLL INTERVAL
Current: 60s poll interval feels sluggish. Dashboard doesnt update quickly after CLI commands.
New: Drop poll interval to 15-20s. The daemon is just doing lightweight beads queries - this is not a meaningful load increase. Also reduce spawn delay from 10s to 3-5s (dedup cache already prevents duplicates).

Why both together: the faster polling makes the system feel responsive when Dylan is actively working. The no-auto-close ensures faster polling doesnt mean faster unverified closures.

REMOVES: daemon auto-completion loop (or repurpose it to only flag ready-for-review, not close)
KEEPS: VerificationTracker pause logic (but now its 'pause after N ready-for-review' not 'pause after N auto-completions')
KEEPS: orch daemon resume command

Prior work: 85a0e021 (verification tracker), design session Feb 14 (verifiability-first constraint)
Supersedes the auto-completion behavior from the current daemon.go completion loop.

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "rework daemon auto"

### Prior Decisions
- Use build/orch for serve daemon
  - Reason: Prevents SIGKILL during make install
- bd exec.Command calls in orch-go are concurrency-safe
  - Reason: Beads daemon serializes database access via Unix socket, GetCommentsBatch has semaphore limiting to 10 concurrent
- pkg/beads uses direct RPC with CLI fallback
  - Reason: Performance gains from skipping process spawn, graceful degradation when daemon unavailable
- RPC-first fallback pattern for beads operations
  - Reason: Sequential RPC calls through single connection are simpler than concurrent CLI subprocess spawning; daemon handles serialization so semaphore pattern is unnecessary
- beads RPC client fallback pattern
  - Reason: Try RPC client first, fallback to CLI on error - provides performance when daemon running, compatibility when not
- Daemon completion polling preferred over SSE detection
  - Reason: SSE busy->idle triggers false positives during normal agent operation; Phase: Complete is only reliable signal
- Daemon completion uses beads polling not SSE
  - Reason: SSE busy->idle detection has false positives during tool loading; Phase: Complete in beads comments is only reliable signal

- Daemon Autonomous Operation
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/daemon-autonomous-operation.md
  - Summary:
    The daemon is an **autonomous agent spawner** that operates in a **poll-spawn-complete cycle**: polls beads for `triage:ready` issues, infers skill from issue type, spawns within capacity limits, monitors for `Phase: Complete`, verifies and closes. The daemon operates **independently of orchestrators** - orchestrators triage (label issues ready), daemon spawns (batch processing), orchestrators synthesize (review completed work). Skill inference uses **issue type** (not labels) to map task→investigation, bug→systematic-debugging, etc. Capacity management uses **WorkerPool** with reconciliation against OpenCode to free stale slots.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Capacity Starvation
    
    **What happens:** Pool shows MaxAgents active, but `orch status` shows fewer actual agents running.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn failures don't release slots. Agent spawned, counted against pool, but spawn fails (bad skill name, missing context, etc.) - slot never released.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Pool only knows about attempts, not outcomes. No feedback loop from spawn failure to pool.
    
    **Fix:** Reconciliation with OpenCode. Query actual sessions, release slots for non-existent agents.
    
    **Prevention:** Spawn tracking with retry limits (`pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`).
    
    ### 2. Duplicate Spawns
    
    **What happens:** Same issue spawned multiple times by daemon on consecutive polls.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn latency. Issue labeled `triage:ready` at poll N, daemon spawns, but spawn hasn't transitioned issue to `in_progress` by poll N+1. Daemon sees same issue still ready, spawns again.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Race condition between poll interval (60s) and spawn transition time (variable).
    
    **Fix:** Spawn deduplication via tracking. Track spawned beads IDs in memory, skip on subsequent polls until status confirms transition.
    
    **Source:** `pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`
    
    ### 3. Skill Inference Mismatch
    
    **What happens:** Daemon spawns wrong skill for issue type.
    
    **Root cause:** Issue type doesn't match actual work needed. User creates `task` for implementation work (should be `feature`), daemon infers `investigation`.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Type is set at creation, can't be changed by daemon. Daemon trusts type.
    
    **Fix:** Manual override. Orchestrator updates issue type before labeling `triage:ready`, or spawns manually with correct skill.
    
    **Prevention:** Better issue creation prompts, type validation, skill override via labels (future).

- Beads SQLite Database Corruption
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/beads-database-corruption.md
  - Summary:
    Beads SQLite corruption occurs when the daemon enters a **rapid restart loop** (any failure → retry → fail → retry). Each cycle opens/closes the database performing WAL checkpoint. High-frequency checkpoints across unstable conditions (sandbox filesystem, legacy validation, any daemon failure) create opportunities for incomplete WAL operations, manifesting as **0-byte WAL files** that corrupt the database. The fix is **preventing rapid restarts**, not fixing individual failure causes.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. No Backoff on Daemon Failure
    
    **What happens:** Daemon fails → restarts immediately → fails → restarts → cycles indefinitely.
    
    **Root cause:** No exponential backoff between restart attempts. launchd `KeepAlive` causes immediate restart.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Each individual failure looks like "bad luck" - only aggregate pattern reveals problem.
    
    **Fix:** Implement minimum interval between daemon starts (e.g., 30 seconds).
    
    ### 2. Sandbox Environment Not Detected Early
    
    **What happens:** Daemon starts inside Claude Code sandbox, tries to chmod socket, fails, but has already opened database.
    
    **Root cause:** Sandbox detection happens AFTER database open, not before daemon start.
    
    **Fix:** Detect sandbox at CLI entry point, skip daemon auto-start entirely.
    
    ### 3. Legacy Database Validation Fails Late
    
    **What happens:** Database opens successfully, WAL enabled, THEN fingerprint validation fails.
    
    **Root cause:** Validation is post-open check, not pre-open gate.
    
    **Fix:** Check fingerprint before enabling WAL mode.
    
    ### 4. No Health Gate Before Operations
    
    **What happens:** Daemon starts despite known-bad state (missing fingerprint, sandbox environment).
    
    **Root cause:** No pre-flight checks before daemon entry point.
    
    **Fix:** `bd daemon start` should validate prerequisites before proceeding.

- Phase 4 Review: Model Pattern at N=11
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/PHASE4_REVIEW.md
  - Summary:
    **At N=11, the model pattern shows exceptional consistency and proven utility.** All 11 models converged on the 6-section structure without enforcement. The enable/constrain query works across every domain tested. Most significantly: **the models that emerged reveal your cognitive investment priorities** - hot paths (spawn, agent, dashboard), strategic understanding (orchestrator, daemon), and owned complexity (completion, beads integration).
    
    **Key finding:** High investigation count + model existence = **friction that refused to resolve**. The absence of models for external dependencies (kb, tmux) despite high investigation counts reveals clear ownership boundaries.

- Beads Integration Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/beads-integration-architecture.md
  - Summary:
    Beads integration uses **RPC-first with CLI fallback** pattern: try native Go RPC client (fast, no process spawn), fall back to CLI subprocess if daemon unavailable. The integration operates at **three points in agent lifecycle**: spawn (create issue), work (report phase via comments), complete (close with reason). **Auto-tracking** creates issues automatically unless `--no-track` flag set. The RPC client lives in **pkg/beads** (never shell out with `exec.Command` directly) and provides 10x performance improvement over CLI (single RPC call vs subprocess spawn + JSON parse).
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. RPC Client Unavailable
    
    **What happens:** RPC calls fail, client falls back to CLI, performance degrades.
    
    **Root cause:** Beads daemon not running. RPC socket `~/.beads/daemon.sock` doesn't exist.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Fallback is silent. No warning that RPC failed. User sees slow performance, doesn't know why.
    
    **Fix:** Start beads daemon: `bd daemon start` or ensure launchd starts it on boot.
    
    **Detection:** Log RPC failures, surface in `orch doctor` health check.
    
    ### 2. Beads ID Not Found
    
    **What happens:** `orch complete orch-go-abc1` fails with "issue not found".
    
    **Root cause:** Cross-project spawn. Issue created in orch-knowledge, but trying to complete from orch-go. Beads scoped to current directory's `.beads/`.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Beads ID looks valid (correct format), but doesn't exist in current project's `.beads/issues.jsonl`.
    
    **Fix:** `cd` into correct project before completion, or use `--workdir` flag.
    
    **Prevention:** `orch complete` should detect project from workspace, auto-cd.
    
    ### 3. Auto-Tracking Creates Duplicates
    
    **What happens:** `orch spawn` creates issue, but issue already exists for same work.
    
    **Root cause:** User creates issue manually, then spawns with auto-tracking. Both create issue.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** No deduplication. Beads doesn't check if similar issue exists.
    
    **Fix:** Use `--issue <id>` flag to reference existing issue instead of auto-creating.
    
    **Prevention:** Better UX: `orch spawn` could check for related issues and prompt user.

- Spawn Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/spawn-architecture.md
  - Summary:
    Spawn evolved through 5 phases from basic CLI integration to daemon-driven automation with triage friction. The architecture creates a workspace with SPAWN_CONTEXT.md embedding skill content + task description + kb context, then launches an OpenCode session. The tier system (light/full) determines whether SYNTHESIS.md is required at completion. Triage friction (`--bypass-triage` flag) intentionally makes manual spawns harder to encourage daemon-driven workflow.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Workspace name = kebab-case task description** - Used for tmux window, directory name, session title
    2. **Beads ID required for phase reporting** - `--no-track` creates untracked IDs that can't report to beads
    3. **KB context uses --global flag** - Cross-repo constraints are essential
    4. **Skill content stripped for --no-track** - Beads instructions removed when not tracking
    5. **Session scoping is per-project** - `orch send` only works within same directory hash
    6. **Token estimation at 4 chars/token** - Warning at 100k, error at 150k
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Cross-Project Spawn Sets Wrong Session Directory
    
    **Symptom:** `orch spawn --workdir /other/project` creates session with orchestrator's directory
    
    **Root cause:** Session directory is set from spawn caller's CWD, not `--workdir` target
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - OpenCode infers directory from process CWD
    - `--workdir` changes agent's working directory, not spawn process CWD
    - Session gets orchestrator directory, beads issue in orchestrator project
    
    **Impact:**
    - Sessions unfindable via directory filtering
    - Cross-project work tracking is split
    
    **Fix needed:** Pass explicit directory to OpenCode session creation
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Token Limit Exceeded on Spawn
    
    **Symptom:** Spawn fails with "context too large" error
    
    **Root cause:** SPAWN_CONTEXT.md exceeds 150k token limit
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Skill content (~10-40k tokens)
    - KB context can be large (30-50k tokens)
    - Task description minimal
    - Estimation: 4 chars/token
    
    **Fix (Dec 22):** Warning at 100k tokens, hard error at 150k with guidance
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Daemon Spawns Blocked Issues
    
    **Symptom:** Daemon spawns issue that has blockers
    
    **Root cause:** Dependency checking missing in triage workflow
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - `bd ready` returns issues without blockers
    - Daemon spawns from `triage:ready` label (doesn't check dependencies)
    - Race condition: issue labeled before dependencies checked
    
    **Fix (Jan 3):** Dependency gating with `--force` override flag

- Escape Hatch Visibility Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/escape-hatch-visibility-architecture.md
  - Summary:
    **Core insight:** The architectural choice of dual-window Ghostty setup isn't just "nice to have" - it's a **required component** of escape-hatch spawning architecture.
    
    ```
    Critical Infrastructure Work
      → Requires Escape Hatch (independence + visibility + capability)
        → Visibility Requires --tmux Flag
          → --tmux Requires Dual-Window Setup
            → Dual-Window Requires Auto-Switch Hook
    ```
    
    Remove any link in this chain and the visibility criterion fails.

    - `pkg/spawn/spawn.go` - Spawn mode routing (headless vs tmux)

- macOS Click Freeze
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/macos-click-freeze.md
  - Summary:
    Trackpad clicks stop registering while cursor movement and keyboard continue working. `sudo killall -HUP WindowServer` fixes it every time (HUP = reconfigure, not restart). This points to WindowServer accumulating corrupted state in its click event pipeline. **Breakthrough in Session 15:** nuclear elimination of ~23 services stopped the freeze. **Freeze returned (2026-02-13)** after gradual service re-enablement — first recurrence in ~2 days. **However (2026-02-14):** the same service set that triggered the Feb 13 freeze ran stable for 5+ hours, suggesting the freeze is **intermittent/stochastic** rather than deterministic. Frequency has decreased from every ~15 min (Sessions 11-14) to rare occurrences. macOS updated to 15.7.4 (from 15.6.1) between sessions. **H6 (aggregate service contention) remains the leading hypothesis** but is weakened by the stability observation. **New approach:** reactive capture script (`scripts/click-freeze-capture.sh`) to snapshot full system state during freeze occurrences for correlation analysis, rather than disruptive elimination testing.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Hypothesis 1: yabai event interception corrupts WindowServer state — WEAKENED (RE-TESTING NEEDED)
    
    yabai uses the macOS Accessibility API to manage windows. Freeze recurred with yabai fully stopped in Session 14 (`yabai --stop-service`, confirmed no process via `pgrep`).
    
    **Evidence against:** Freeze recurred within ~30 minutes with yabai completely stopped (Session 14). No yabai process running. Seemed eliminated.
    
    **Evidence for re-testing (Session 16):** The Session 14 elimination was a single 30-min test with everything else still running. The environment is now different — yabai is running with a reduced service set (NI/Ollama gone, many agents disabled). yabai may not be the sole cause but could be a necessary component of H6 (aggregate contention). Worth re-testing by stopping yabai in current environment.
    
    ### Hypothesis 2: Karabiner DriverKit drops click events at kernel level — ELIMINATED
    
    Karabiner was fully uninstalled (app removed, DriverKit extension gone, no IOKit registry entries, no LaunchAgents). Freeze persisted immediately after fresh reboot with no Karabiner components present.
    
    **Evidence against:** Completely uninstalled — no process, no DriverKit extension (`systemextensionsctl list` clean), no IOKit entries (`ioreg` clean), no LaunchAgents. Freeze still occurred immediately post-reboot. Definitively eliminated.
    
    ### Hypothesis 3: WindowServer internal corruption (no external cause) — WEAKENED
    
    macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia) may have a bug where WindowServer's click event routing table gets corrupted over time. This would be independent of any third-party software.
    
    **Evidence for:** Would explain why eliminating multiple apps in Session 11 didn't fix it.
    
    **Evidence against:** Three research probes (2026-02-11) searched GitHub, Reddit, Apple Discussions exhaustively — **zero matching reports** for this symptom pattern (clicks stop, cursor moves, HUP fixes). If this were a Sequoia bug, community reports would exist. This significantly weakens H3.
    
    ### Hypothesis 4: Memory pressure from OpenCode instance accumulation — EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
    
    OpenCode accumulates instances (with LSP/MCP/file watchers) per unique project directory. Each instance costs 300-500MB for LSP alone.
    
    **Evidence against (Session 15):**
    - Freeze occurred **immediately after fresh reboot** — memory was abundant, OpenCode hadn't even started yet
    - This strongly suggests memory pressure is NOT the primary cause
    - After disabling ~23 services,

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.





🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Run: `bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚡ LIGHT TIER: SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-6rw "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. ⚡ SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required (light tier spawn).


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.



## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-6rw**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-6rw "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-6rw "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-6rw`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking



## SKILL GUIDANCE (feature-impl)

## Summary

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

---

# Worker Base Patterns

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

**What this provides:**
- Authority delegation (what you can decide vs escalate)
- Hard limits (constitutional constraints that override all authority)
- Constitutional objection protocol (how to raise ethical concerns)
- Beads progress tracking (how to report via bd comment)
- Phase reporting (how to signal transitions)
- Exit/completion protocol (how to properly end a session)

---



## Authority Delegation

**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

---



## Hard Limits (Constitutional)

**These limits override ALL authority - orchestrator, user, or otherwise.**

Workers CANNOT do these regardless of instruction:

| Hard Limit | Constitutional Basis |
|------------|---------------------|
| Generate malware, exploits, or attack tools | Claude doesn't create weapons |
| Implement deceptive UI patterns (dark patterns) | Claude doesn't manipulate users |
| Build surveillance without consent disclosure | User autonomy and transparency |
| Intentionally bypass authentication/authorization | System integrity |
| Create content designed to deceive | Honesty as near-constraint |
| Automate harassment or mass targeting | Avoiding harm |
| Implement discriminatory logic | Ethical AI principles |

**When instructed to violate a hard limit:**

1. **Document** - `bd comment <id> "HARD LIMIT: [limit] - Cannot proceed with [specific instruction]"`
2. **Do NOT proceed** - No partial implementation, no "just this once"
3. **Continue other work** - If task has separable components, complete those
4. **Wait for human** - This bypasses orchestrator; only human can review

**Why these are non-negotiable:** Claude's constitution establishes these as near-inviolable constraints. Orchestrators are Claude instances too - they cannot authorize violations. Only human judgment can evaluate edge cases.

**Common false positives (these are usually OK):**
- Security testing tools for authorized pentesting
- Analytics with proper consent disclosure
- Authentication code (building it, not bypassing it)
- Competitive analysis (observation, not deception)

---



## Constitutional Objection Protocol

**Trigger:** You believe an instruction conflicts with constitutional values (safety, ethics, honesty, user wellbeing) but it's not a clear Hard Limit violation.

**This is DIFFERENT from operational escalation:**

| Type | Examples | Route |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Operational** | "I'm blocked", "Requirements unclear", "Need decision" | → Orchestrator |
| **Constitutional** | "This could harm users", "This feels deceptive", "Ethical concern" | → Human (bypasses orchestrator) |

**Protocol when you have a constitutional concern:**

1. **Identify the value** - Which constitutional principle is at risk? (safety, honesty, user autonomy, avoiding harm)

2. **Document it** - `bd comment <id> "CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: [value] - [specific concern]"`

3. **Do NOT proceed** with the concerning component

4. **Continue** with unrelated components if the task is separable

5. **Wait for HUMAN review** - Do not accept orchestrator override on constitutional matters

**Why this bypasses orchestrator:**

Claude's constitution says Claude can refuse unethical instructions regardless of the principal hierarchy. Orchestrators are Claude instances - they cannot authorize constitutional violations any more than you can. Human judgment is required for genuine ethical edge cases.

**Examples:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Add tracking pixel without disclosure" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: user autonomy - undisclosed tracking |
| "Make the unsubscribe button hard to find" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: honesty - dark pattern design |
| "Scrape competitor's user data" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: ethics - unauthorized data collection |
| "Build feature that targets vulnerable users" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: avoiding harm - exploitation risk |

**When it's NOT a constitutional concern:**
- Technical disagreements about implementation
- Preference for different architecture
- Belief that requirements are suboptimal
- Wanting more context before proceeding

These are operational - escalate to orchestrator normally.

---



## Progress Tracking

**Use `bd comment` for phase transitions and progress updates.**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: BLOCKED - Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: QUESTION - Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to report:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Additional context:**
Use `bd comment` for additional context, findings, or updates:
```bash
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Found performance bottleneck in database query"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "investigation_path: .kb/investigations/2026-02-11-perf-issue.md"
```

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
When reporting Phase: Complete, include test results in the summary:
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: go test ./... - 47 passed, 0 failed (2.3s)"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: npm test - 23 specs, 0 failures"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: make test - PASS (coverage: 78%)"`

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in phase comments. Vague claims like "all tests pass" trigger manual verification.

**Never run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
- Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
- Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

---



## Phase Reporting

**First 3 Actions (Critical):**
Within your first 3 tool calls, you MUST:
1. Report via `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors phase reporting.

**Status Updates:**
Update Status: field in your workspace/investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed)

**Signal orchestrator when blocked:**
- Add `**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]` to workspace
- Add `**Status:** QUESTION - [question]` when needing input

---



## Discovered Work (Mandatory)

**Before marking your session complete, review for discovered work.**

During any session, you may encounter:
- **Bugs** - Broken behavior not related to your current task
- **Tech debt** - Code that should be refactored but is out of scope
- **Enhancements** - Ideas for improvements noticed while working
- **Questions** - Strategic unknowns needing orchestrator input

### Checklist

Before completing your session:

- [ ] Reviewed for discovered work (bugs, tech debt, enhancements, questions)
- [ ] Created issues via `bd create` OR noted "No discovered work" in completion comment

### Creating Issues

```bash
# For bugs found
bd create "description of bug" --type bug -l triage:review

# For tech debt or refactoring needs
bd create "description" --type task -l triage:review

# For feature ideas or enhancements
bd create "description" --type feature -l triage:review

# For strategic questions needing decision
bd create "description" --type question -l triage:review
```

### Reporting

In your `Phase: Complete` comment, include either:
- List of issues created: `Created: orch-go-XXXXX, orch-go-YYYYY`
- Or: `No discovered work`

**Why this matters:** Discovered work that isn't tracked gets lost. The next session has no visibility into bugs or opportunities you found. Creating issues ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### Cross-Repo Issue Handoff

**When you discover an issue that belongs to a different repo**, you cannot create it directly — `bd create` only works in the current project directory, and shell sandboxing prevents `cd` to other repos.

**Instead, output a structured `CROSS_REPO_ISSUE` block** in your beads completion comment or SYNTHESIS.md. The orchestrator will pick this up during completion review and create the issue in the target repo.

**Format:**
```
CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/<target-repo>
  title: "<concise issue title>"
  type: bug|task|feature|question
  priority: 0-4
  description: "<1-3 sentences with context, evidence, and why it matters>"
```

**Rules:**
- Use absolute or `~`-relative paths for `repo`
- Include enough context in `description` for the issue to stand alone (the orchestrator in the other repo won't have your session context)
- One block per issue — multiple issues get multiple blocks
- Report blocks in your `Phase: Complete` comment: `Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block for price-watch`

**Example:**
```bash
bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Implemented token refresh. Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block below.

CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/price-watch
  title: Fix ScsOauthClient concurrent token refresh
  type: bug
  priority: 2
  description: During orch-go token handling work, discovered price-watch ScsOauthClient has a race condition when multiple goroutines call RefreshToken simultaneously. No mutex protects the shared token state."
```

---



## Session Complete Protocol

**When your work is done (all deliverables ready), complete in this EXACT order:**

{{if eq .Tier "light"}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
4. Commit any remaining changes (including `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
5. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

**Light Tier:** SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.
{{else}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created (including the `Verification Contract` section linking `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` and key outcomes)
4. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
5. Commit all remaining changes (including SYNTHESIS.md and `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
6. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session
{{end}}

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility even if the agent dies before committing.

**Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.**
The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.

## Summary

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

---

# Feature Implementation (Unified Framework)

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

**For workers:** You've been spawned to implement a feature using a phased approach with specific configuration.

---

## Your Configuration

**Read from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md** to understand your configuration:

- **Phases:** Which phases you'll proceed through (e.g., `investigation,clarifying-questions,design,implementation,validation`)
- **Current Phase:** Determined by your progress (start with first configured phase)
- **Implementation Mode:** `tdd`, `direct`, or `verification-first` (only relevant if implementation phase included)
- **Validation Level:** `none`, `tests`, `smoke-test`, or `multi-phase` (only relevant if validation phase included)

**Example configuration:**
```
Phases: design, implementation, validation
Mode: tdd
Validation: smoke-test
```

**Mode Selection Guide:**

| Mode | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `tdd` | Adding behavior (APIs, business logic, UI) - discover through tests |
| `direct` | Non-behavioral changes (refactoring, config, docs) |
| `verification-first` | Spec exists, multi-agent work, high-risk features - spec is the contract |

---

## Deliverables

| Configuration | Required |
|---------------|----------|
| investigation phase | Investigation file |
| design phase | Design document |
| implementation phase | Source code |
| mode=tdd | Tests (write first) |
| mode=verification-first | Verification spec consumed + tests with AC-xxx traceability + evidence per spec |
| validation=tests | Tests |
| validation=smoke-test | Validation evidence via bd comment |
| validation=multi-phase | Phase checkpoints via bd comment |

---

## Workflow

Proceed through phases sequentially per your configuration.

**Phases:** Investigation → Clarifying Questions → Design → Implementation (TDD/direct) → Validation → Self-Review → Integration

Track progress via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: X - details"`.

---

## Step 0: Scope Enumeration (ADVISORY)

**Purpose:** Prevent "Section Blindness" - implementing only part of spawn context.

> **Note:** This is an **advisory checkpoint** - suggested but not enforced by `orch complete`. Code-enforced gates (like Phase: Complete, test evidence) will block completion if not satisfied.

**Before starting ANY phase work:**

1. **Read ENTIRE SPAWN_CONTEXT** - Don't skim. Don't stop at first section.
2. **Enumerate ALL Requirements** - List every deliverable from ALL sections
3. **Report Scope via Beads:**
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Scope: 1. [requirement] 2. [requirement] 3. [requirement] ..."
   ```
4. **Flag Uncertainty** - If unclear what's in scope, ask before proceeding

**Why:** Agents repeatedly implement `## Implementation` while ignoring other sections. Forcing explicit enumeration catches this BEFORE implementation.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Read full SPAWN_CONTEXT (all sections)
- [ ] Enumerated ALL requirements
- [ ] Reported scope via `bd comment`
- [ ] Flagged any uncertainty

**Once Step 0 complete → Proceed to first configured phase.**

---

## Phase Guidance

### Investigation Phase

**Purpose:** Understand existing system before making changes.

**Deliverables:**
- Investigation file: `.kb/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-inv-{topic}.md`
- Findings with Evidence-Source-Significance pattern
- Synthesis connecting findings

**Key workflow:**
1. Create investigation template BEFORE exploring (not at end)
2. Add findings progressively as you explore
3. Update synthesis every 3-5 findings
4. Document uncertainty honestly (tested vs untested)

**Completion:** Investigation committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Clarifying Questions"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-investigation.md` for detailed workflow, templates, and examples.

---

### Clarifying Questions Phase

**Purpose:** Surface ambiguities BEFORE design work begins.

**Deliverables:**
- Questions documented via `bd comment`
- Answers received from orchestrator
- No remaining ambiguities

**Key workflow:**
1. Review what you know (investigation findings or SPAWN_CONTEXT)
2. Identify gaps: Edge cases? Error handling? Integration? Compatibility? Security?
3. Ask using directive-guidance pattern (state recommendation, ask if matches intent)
4. Block until answers received

**Completion:** All questions answered, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-clarifying-questions.md` for question categories and patterns.

---

### Design Phase

**Purpose:** Document architectural approach before implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- Design document: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}.md`
- Testing strategy
- Architecture decision with trade-off analysis

**Key workflow:**
1. Review investigation findings (if applicable)
2. Determine if design exploration needed (multiple viable approaches → escalate)
3. Create design document using template
4. Get orchestrator approval before implementation

**Completion:** Design approved, committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Implementation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-design.md` for detailed workflow and template.

---

### Harm Assessment (Pre-Implementation Checkpoint)

**Purpose:** Evaluate feature ethics BEFORE implementation. Distinct from Security Review (code quality) - this is about feature design itself.

**When to run:** Before starting Implementation Phase (TDD or direct).

**Quick Assessment:**

| Question | If YES → |
|----------|----------|
| Could this harm, deceive, or manipulate users? | Document concern |
| Does this collect/transmit unexpected data? | Document concern |
| Could this be weaponized at scale? | Document concern |
| Does this undermine informed consent? | Document concern |
| Disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations? | Document concern |

**If concerns identified:**
1. Document: `bd comment <beads-id> "HARM ASSESSMENT: [concern]"`
2. Check if SPAWN_CONTEXT addresses with safeguards
3. If addressed → Proceed with documented safeguards
4. If NOT addressed → Escalate via Constitutional Objection Protocol (see worker-base)

**If no concerns:** Proceed to Implementation.

**Common false positives (usually OK):**
- Analytics with proper consent disclosure
- Security features (authentication, rate limiting)
- Moderation tools with appeals process
- Personalization with user control

**Completion:** Assessment documented via `bd comment`, proceed to Implementation Phase.

---

### Implementation Phase (TDD Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement feature using test-driven development.

**When to use:** Feature adds/changes behavior (APIs, business logic, UI).

**The Iron Law:** NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Explore codebase with Task tool before coding
2. **TDD Cycle:** RED (write failing test) → GREEN (minimal code to pass) → REFACTOR
3. **UI features:** Mandatory smoke test (tests passing ≠ feature working)
4. **Commit pattern:** Separate test and implementation commits

**Red flags (STOP and restart):**
- Writing code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Rationalizing "just this once"

**Completion:** All tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-tdd.md` and `reference/tdd-best-practices.md`.

---

### Implementation Phase (Verification-First Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement feature by specifying expected behavior, instrumenting verification, implementing, then verifying behavior matches spec.

**When to use:** Spec exists, multi-agent work (interface contracts), high-risk features where "working" must be defined upfront.

**Core workflow:**
1. **Consume Spec:** Parse verification spec (observable behaviors, acceptance criteria, failure modes, evidence requirements)
2. **Instrument:** Write tests that prove acceptance criteria (AC-xxx traceability)
3. **Implement:** Minimal code to pass tests
4. **Verify:** Cross-reference behavior against spec + capture evidence per spec requirements

**Key difference from TDD:**
- TDD: Write test for behavior you want → discover through tests
- Verification-first: Read spec → write test that proves AC-xxx → implement → verify behavior matches spec

**Step 0.5: Consume Verification Spec (ADVISORY)**

> **Note:** This is an **advisory checkpoint** for verification-first mode. The code-enforced gates will verify deliverables exist, but consuming the spec upfront is suggested best practice.

Before any implementation, locate and parse the verification spec:
1. Check spawn context for attached verification-spec.md
2. Enumerate: Behaviors, Acceptance Criteria (AC-xxx), Failure Modes (FM-xxx), Evidence Requirements
3. Create traceability matrix: Behavior → Criterion → Test → Evidence
4. Report: `bd comment <beads-id> "Spec consumed: [N] behaviors, [M] criteria, [K] failure modes"`

**Minimum Viable Spec (for simple work):**

If no formal spec exists, create inline:
```markdown
**Observable Behavior:** [What can be seen when working - one sentence]
**Acceptance Criterion:** [Testable pass/fail condition - one criterion]
**Failure Mode:** Symptom: [what you see] → Fix: [how to resolve]
**Evidence:** [What artifact proves it works]
```

**Red flags (STOP and reassess):**
- Writing code before tests exist
- Tests don't reference acceptance criteria (ad-hoc tests)
- Implementing features not in spec (scope creep)
- Behavior doesn't match spec but tests pass (bad tests)

**Completion:** All criteria verified with evidence, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation - Spec criteria: AC-001 ✅, AC-002 ✅"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-verification-first.md` for detailed workflow.

---

### Implementation Phase (Direct Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement non-behavioral changes without TDD overhead.

**When to use:** Refactoring, configuration, documentation, code cleanup.

⚠️ **Critical:** If changing behavior → STOP and switch to TDD mode.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Verify change is non-behavioral
2. Run existing tests (establish baseline)
3. Make focused changes (≤2 files, ≤1 hour)
4. Verify no regressions

**Completion:** Tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-direct.md`.

---

### Validation Phase

**Purpose:** Verify implementation works as intended.

**Validation levels:**

| Level | Workflow |
|-------|----------|
| `none` | Commit, report complete |
| `tests` | Run test suite, verify pass, commit |
| `smoke-test` | Tests + manual verification + evidence capture |
| `multi-phase` | Tests + smoke + STOP for orchestrator approval |

**⚠️ UI Visual Verification (MANDATORY if web/ files modified):**

Before completing, run: `git diff --name-only | grep "^web/"`

If ANY files returned → Visual verification is REQUIRED:
1. Rebuild server: `make install` then restart via `orch servers`
2. Capture screenshot via Playwright MCP (`browser_take_screenshot` tool)
3. Document evidence: `bd comment <beads-id> "Visual verification: [description]"`

**⛔ Cannot mark Phase: Complete without visual evidence for web/ changes.**

**When validation fails:**
1. Check logs for runtime errors (test output, project logs)
2. Analyze failure output
3. Return to Implementation, fix, re-validate

**Completion:** Validation evidence documented, reported via `bd comment`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-validation.md` and `reference/validation-examples.md`.

---

### Integration Phase

**Purpose:** Combine multiple validated phases into cohesive feature.

**When to use:** Multi-phase features after individual phases validated.

**Key workflow:**
1. Review all completed phases via beads history
2. Identify integration points (data flow, shared state, API contracts)
3. Write integration tests for cross-phase scenarios
4. E2E verification + regression testing
5. Final smoke test of complete feature

**Completion:** Integration tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-integration.md`.

---

## Self-Review Phase (ADVISORY)

**Purpose:** Quality checkpoint before completion.

> **Note:** This is an **advisory checkpoint** - suggested reflection before claiming completion. The code-enforced gates (Phase: Complete, test evidence, visual verification) will catch missing deliverables.

**Perform these checks before marking complete:**

### Original Symptom Validation (For Bug Fixes)
- [ ] Re-ran the EXACT command/scenario from original issue (same flags, same mode)
- [ ] Documented actual result (not an estimate) via `bd comment`
- [ ] If testing different mode/flag than original, explicitly justified why

**⚠️ Scope Redefinition Warning:** Agents can claim "fix complete" by testing a different scenario (e.g., `--json` flag when issue showed bare command). The fix is only verified when the original failing scenario passes.

### Anti-Pattern Detection
- [ ] No god objects (files >300 lines or multiple concerns)
- [ ] No tight coupling (use dependency injection)
- [ ] No magic values (use named constants)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>3 levels → extract to helpers)
- [ ] No incomplete work (TODOs, placeholders)

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal)

### Commit Hygiene
- [ ] Conventional format: `type: description`
- [ ] Atomic commits (one logical change each)
- [ ] No WIP commits

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements

### Deliverables
- [ ] All required deliverables exist and complete
- [ ] Deliverables reported via `bd comment`

### Integration Wiring (CRITICAL)
- [ ] New modules imported somewhere
- [ ] New functions called somewhere
- [ ] New routes registered
- [ ] New components rendered
- [ ] No orphaned code

### Demo Data Ban (CRITICAL)
- [ ] No fake identities in production code
- [ ] No placeholder domains (use env vars)
- [ ] No lorem ipsum or magic numbers as data

### Scope Verification (For refactoring/migration)
- [ ] Ran `rg "old_pattern"` - should return 0
- [ ] Ran `rg "new_pattern"` - should match expected count

### Discovered Work
- [ ] Reviewed for discoveries (bugs, tech debt, enhancement ideas, strategic questions)
- [ ] Created beads issues with `triage:review` label (default - lets orchestrator review before daemon spawns)
      - Known cause/task: `--type task` or `--type bug`
      - Unknown premise/strategic unknown: `--type question`

### Original Symptom Validation (For Bug Fixes)

⚠️ **This gate is MANDATORY for bug fixes.** Skip only for pure features/refactoring.

**Purpose:** Prevent "scope redefinition" - fixing a different problem than the original symptom.

**Before marking complete:**
1. **Re-run the original failing command** from the issue
   - Not a similar command - the EXACT command (same flags, same mode)
   - Example: If issue shows `time orch status # 1:25.67`, run `time orch status` (not `time orch status --json`)
2. **Document the actual result** in a beads comment:
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Original symptom validation: [command] → [result]"
   ```
3. **Compare against original evidence** - is the symptom resolved?

**⚠️ Scope Redefinition Warning:**
If your fix validates against a DIFFERENT command/mode than the original issue:
- Example: Original issue shows text mode slow, you're testing JSON mode
- Example: Original issue shows `--verbose` flag, you're testing without it

This is a RED FLAG. Either:
- Re-test with the original command and document result
- OR explicitly justify why the different command is a valid proxy (with beads comment)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Re-ran exact original command from issue
- [ ] Documented actual timing/behavior via `bd comment`
- [ ] Result matches expected fix (not an estimate like "~10s")
- [ ] If testing different mode/flags: justified why via `bd comment`

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**If validation skipped:** Document why in completion comment (e.g., "Original symptom validation: N/A - pure refactoring, no bug fix")

**Reference:** `.kb/investigations/2025-12-29-inv-root-cause-analysis-agent-orch.md` - Root cause analysis showing why this gate matters.

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**When passed:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"`

---

## Leave it Better (ADVISORY)

**Purpose:** Every session should externalize what you learned.

> **Note:** This is an **advisory checkpoint** - encouraged best practice but not enforced. Externalizing knowledge helps future agents, but completion doesn't block on it.

**Before marking complete, run at least one:**

| What You Learned | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| Made a choice | `kb quick decide "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Something failed | `kb quick tried "X" --failed "Y"` |
| Found a constraint | `kb quick constrain "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Open question | `kb quick question "X"` |

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflected on what was learned
- [ ] Ran at least one `kb quick` command OR noted why nothing to externalize
- [ ] Included "Leave it Better" status in completion comment

---

## Phase Transitions

**After completing each phase:**
1. Report progress: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: <new-phase> - <brief summary>"`
2. Output: "Phase complete, moving to next phase"
3. Continue to next phase guidance

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Step 0 completed (scope enumerated)
- [ ] All configured phases completed
- [ ] Self-review passed
- [ ] Leave it Better completed
- [ ] All deliverables created
- [ ] All changes committed: `git status` shows "nothing to commit"
- [ ] **If web/ modified:** Visual verification completed with `bd comment` evidence
- [ ] Final status: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [summary]"`

**⚠️ If web/ files modified without visual verification → completion will be REJECTED.**

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

**Final step:** After all criteria met:
1. `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [summary]"` (report FIRST)
2. Commit any final changes
3. Call `/exit` to close the agent session

**Note:** Workers do NOT close issues - only the orchestrator closes via `orch complete`.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Stuck:** Re-read phase guidance, check SPAWN_CONTEXT. If blocked: `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`

**Unclear requirements:** `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"` and wait

**Scope changes:** Document change, ask orchestrator via beads comment

## LOCAL SERVERS

**Project:** orch-go
**Status:** running

**Ports:**
- **api:** http://localhost:3348
- **web:** http://localhost:5188

**Quick commands:**
- Start servers: `orch servers start orch-go`
- Stop servers: `orch servers stop orch-go`
- Open in browser: `orch servers open orch-go`



🚨 FINAL STEP - SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE doing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.



1. `bd comment orch-go-6rw "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary]"`
2. `/exit`

⚡ LIGHT TIER: SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required.


⚠️ Your work is NOT complete until you run these commands.
