TASK: Audit: 4 verifiability-first issues were closed without actual verification. orch-go-6th (skill update never deployed), orch-go-7jl (VerificationTracker never wired), orch-go-tyi (explain-back gate reworked by w50), orch-go-w50 (--explain flag exists but doesn't write to checkpoint). For each: verify current state of the code, whether the claimed work actually landed and functions, and document what's broken vs working.

SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "audit verifiability first"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- orch complete must verify SYNTHESIS.md exists and is not placeholder before closing issue
  - Reason: 70% of agents completed without synthesis in 24h chaos period
- OpenCode attach mode only creates sessions after first message received
  - Reason: TUI startup is not session creation - must send prompt before looking up session ID

### Prior Decisions
- orch spawn context delivery is reliable
  - Reason: Verified that SPAWN_CONTEXT.md is correctly populated and accessible by the agent
- Session ID resolution pattern
  - Reason: Commands that need to find agents should use resolveSessionID or the runTail pattern: workspace files first, then API lookup, then tmux fallback
- When spawned for cross-repo work, verify work completion status before starting
  - Reason: Task orch-go-oo1f: spawned in orch-go for work in orch-knowledge. Template was already retired (commit 7430185) before agent fully engaged. Quick verification could have saved agent context.
- Headless spawn mode is production-ready
  - Reason: All 5 requirements verified working: status detection, monitoring, completion detection, error handling, user visibility. Investigation orch-go-0r2q confirmed no blockers exist.
- Help text should be organized by mode hierarchy (default → opt-in → blocking)
  - Reason: Users need to see default behavior first; mode grouping in examples improves discoverability and understanding
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- Layer 2 skill constraint verification already implemented in orch-go
  - Reason: pkg/verify/constraint.go (211 lines) parses SKILL-CONSTRAINTS block from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md and verifies required/optional patterns via VerifyCompletionFull()
- beads RPC migration pattern
  - Reason: Try RPC client first, fall through to CLI on any error (socket not found, connect failed, operation failed) - graceful degradation
- beads RPC client fallback pattern
  - Reason: Try RPC client first, fallback to CLI on error - provides performance when daemon running, compatibility when not
- Skill output verification parses skill.yaml directly
  - Reason: skillc verify CLI doesn't exist, so we parse outputs.required from skill.yaml files in Go

  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-14.
    Changed files: pkg/verify/check.go, pkg/verify/visual.go, .beads/issues.jsonl.
    Deleted files: pkg/verify/phase.go, pkg/verify/evidence.go, cmd/orch/complete.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Completion verification operates through **three independent gates** (Phase, Evidence, Approval) that check different aspects of "done". Phase gate verifies agent claims completion, Evidence gate requires visual/test proof in beads comments, Approval gate (UI changes only) requires human sign-off. Verification is **tier-aware**: light tier checks Phase + commits, full tier adds SYNTHESIS.md, orchestrator tier checks SESSION_HANDOFF.md instead. The **5-tier escalation model** surfaces knowledge-producing work (investigation/architect/research) for mandatory orchestrator review before auto-closing. Cross-project detection uses SPAWN_CONTEXT.md to determine which directory to verify in. **Targeted bypasses** (`--skip-{gate} "reason"`) replace blanket `--force`, allowing specific gates to be skipped while others still run.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Evidence Gate False Positive
    
    
    **What happens:** Agent passes Evidence gate without actual visual verification.
    
    **Root cause:** Agent generates screenshot placeholder text ("Screenshot attached") without actually attaching screenshot. Evidence gate searches for keyword "screenshot", finds it, passes.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Text-based keyword matching can't distinguish placeholder from actual proof.
    
    **Fix:** Approval gate for UI changes. Even if Evidence passes, human must verify via --approve.
    
    **Why this matters:** False positive on Evidence gate means broken UI ships thinking it's verified.
    
    ### 2. Approval Gate Bypass
    
    **What happens:** Non-UI changes accidentally avoid approval gate.
    
    **Root cause:** File path detection (`modifiedWebFiles()`) misclassifies files. `web-utils/` not under `web/`, approval skipped.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** File structure varies across projects. Heuristics (path contains "web") can miss edge cases.
    
    **Fix:** Explicit skill-based detection. `feature-impl` with UI flag requires approval, regardless of file paths.
    
    **Future:** Skill manifest declares "requires_ui_approval: true".
    
    ### 3. Cross-Project Verification Wrong Directory
    
    **What happens:** Verification runs in wrong directory, checks wrong tests, reports false failure.
    
    **Root cause:** `SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` missing PROJECT_DIR, fallback uses workspace location (orch-go), but agent worked in orch-cli.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Workspace location != work location. No guaranteed signal of where work happened.
    
    **Fix:** `orch spawn --workdir` explicitly sets PROJECT_DIR in SPAWN_CONTEXT.md. Verification reads it.
    
    **Prevention:** Make --workdir mandatory for cross-project spawns, fail spawn if missing.

- macOS Click Freeze
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/macos-click-freeze.md
  - Summary:
    Trackpad clicks stop registering while cursor movement and keyboard continue working. `sudo killall -HUP WindowServer` fixes it every time (HUP = reconfigure, not restart). This points to WindowServer accumulating corrupted state in its click event pipeline. **Breakthrough in Session 15:** nuclear elimination of ~23 services stopped the freeze. **Freeze returned (2026-02-13)** after gradual service re-enablement — first recurrence in ~2 days. **However (2026-02-14):** the same service set that triggered the Feb 13 freeze ran stable for 5+ hours, suggesting the freeze is **intermittent/stochastic** rather than deterministic. Frequency has decreased from every ~15 min (Sessions 11-14) to rare occurrences. macOS updated to 15.7.4 (from 15.6.1) between sessions. **H6 (aggregate service contention) remains the leading hypothesis** but is weakened by the stability observation. **New approach:** reactive capture script (`scripts/click-freeze-capture.sh`) to snapshot full system state during freeze occurrences for correlation analysis, rather than disruptive elimination testing.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Hypothesis 1: yabai event interception corrupts WindowServer state — WEAKENED (RE-TESTING NEEDED)
    
    yabai uses the macOS Accessibility API to manage windows. Freeze recurred with yabai fully stopped in Session 14 (`yabai --stop-service`, confirmed no process via `pgrep`).
    
    **Evidence against:** Freeze recurred within ~30 minutes with yabai completely stopped (Session 14). No yabai process running. Seemed eliminated.
    
    **Evidence for re-testing (Session 16):** The Session 14 elimination was a single 30-min test with everything else still running. The environment is now different — yabai is running with a reduced service set (NI/Ollama gone, many agents disabled). yabai may not be the sole cause but could be a necessary component of H6 (aggregate contention). Worth re-testing by stopping yabai in current environment.
    
    ### Hypothesis 2: Karabiner DriverKit drops click events at kernel level — ELIMINATED
    
    Karabiner was fully uninstalled (app removed, DriverKit extension gone, no IOKit registry entries, no LaunchAgents). Freeze persisted immediately after fresh reboot with no Karabiner components present.
    
    **Evidence against:** Completely uninstalled — no process, no DriverKit extension (`systemextensionsctl list` clean), no IOKit entries (`ioreg` clean), no LaunchAgents. Freeze still occurred immediately post-reboot. Definitively eliminated.
    
    ### Hypothesis 3: WindowServer internal corruption (no external cause) — WEAKENED
    
    macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia) may have a bug where WindowServer's click event routing table gets corrupted over time. This would be independent of any third-party software.
    
    **Evidence for:** Would explain why eliminating multiple apps in Session 11 didn't fix it.
    
    **Evidence against:** Three research probes (2026-02-11) searched GitHub, Reddit, Apple Discussions exhaustively — **zero matching reports** for this symptom pattern (clicks stop, cursor moves, HUP fixes). If this were a Sequoia bug, community reports would exist. This significantly weakens H3.
    
    ### Hypothesis 4: Memory pressure from OpenCode instance accumulation — EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
    
    OpenCode accumulates instances (with LSP/MCP/file watchers) per unique project directory. Each instance costs 300-500MB for LSP alone.
    
    **Evidence against (Session 15):**
    - Freeze occurred **immediately after fresh reboot** — memory was abundant, OpenCode hadn't even started yet
    - This strongly suggests memory pressure is NOT the primary cause
    - After disabling ~23 services,

- Coaching Plugin
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/coaching-plugin.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-14 (worker detection fix verified).
    Changed files: plugins/coaching.ts, pkg/opencode/client.go.
    Deleted files: ~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The Coaching Plugin is an OpenCode plugin that provides real-time behavioral feedback to orchestrators and workers through tool usage pattern detection. It implements the "Pain as Signal" architectural pattern: agents should feel friction in real-time rather than learning about it post-hoc.
    
    The plugin hooks `tool.execute.after` to observe tool usage patterns (it cannot see LLM response text—fundamental constraint), detects 8 behavioral patterns using behavioral proxies (action ratio, analysis paralysis, frame collapse, etc.), and injects coaching messages via `client.session.prompt({ noReply: true })`. Metrics persist to `~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl` and are exposed via `/api/coaching` for dashboard visualization.
    
    **Current status (Feb 2026):** Both orchestrator and worker coaching operational. Orchestrator coaching: 1000+ metrics collected. Worker health tracking: verified working Feb 14 — stress test (50+ tool calls) emitted `context_usage` worker metric with zero orchestrator metric leakage. Fix required two opencode fork commits (459a1bfba, 0922edfe7) to: (1) read `x-opencode-env-ORCH_WORKER` header and set `session.metadata.role='worker'`, (2) pass `session.metadata` through `tool.execute.after` plugin hooks. **Note:** Worker detection only works for headless (OpenCode HTTP API) spawns — Claude CLI/tmux spawns bypass the HTTP session creation endpoint and don't get metadata set.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Plugins cannot see LLM response text** - Only tool calls visible, not free-text responses. Fundamental constraint, not fixable.
    2. **Behavioral proxies are the only detection mechanism** - All pattern detection uses tool usage as proxy signals.
    3. **Metrics persist, session state doesn't** - JSONL file survives restarts, in-memory Map is ephemeral.
    4. **Observation coupled to intervention** - Injection only fires from `flushMetrics` within `tool.execute.after` hook.
    5. **Worker detection caching is one-way** - Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`.
    6. **Two injection mechanisms serve different purposes** - `config.instructions` adds file references at config time (static context like skills), `client.session.prompt(noReply: true)` injects content at runtime (immediate coaching).
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Worker Detection Caching Bug (Jan 10-17)
    
    **Symptom:** Zero worker health metrics in production despite implemented code
    
    **Root cause:** `detectWorkerSession()` cached both `true` AND `false` results, permanently misclassifying workers if ANY tool call happened before a worker-identifying signal
    
    **Why it happens:**
    1. Worker session starts, first tool = `glob` (no detection signal)
    2. `isWorker = false` → cached → function returns `false` forever
    3. Second tool = `read SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` → cached result returned, detection skipped
    4. Worker treated as orchestrator for entire session
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    First non-matching tool call → cache false → subsequent detection signals ignored → worker health code never runs
    ```
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`. Allow re-evaluation on each tool call until worker confirmed.
    
    **Pattern established:** "Never cache negative results in per-session detection"
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Invalid Detection Signal (Bash workdir)
    
    **Symptom:** Detection code exists but never fires
    
    **Root cause:** Detection checked for `args.workdir` on bash tool, but bash tool has no `workdir` argument
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Bash tool args are: `command`, `timeout`, `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `run_in_background`
    - No `workdir` argument exists
    - Detection signal `if (tool === "bash" && args?.workdir)` never matches
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Removed broken detection signal, restored file-path detection for any `.orch/workspace/` path
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Observation Coupled to Intervention (Restart Brittleness)
    
    **Symptom:** Coaching messages stop after OpenCode server restart, even though metrics show problems
    
    **Root cause:** Injection is implemented as side effect of metric collection, not as separate concern that can operate independently
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Metrics are **persistent** (JSONL file, survive restart)
    - Session state is **in-memory** (Map, lost on restart)
    - Injection logic **coupled to metric collection** (only happens via `flushMetrics`)
    - After restart: metrics file shows "poor" status, but no session state exists, so injection never fires
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    Server restart → session state lost → flushMetrics not called → injection doesn't fire → coaching stops
    ```
    
    **Architectural fix (not yet implemented):** Separate injection into independent daemon that reads metrics from JSONL and injects via OpenCode API, completely decoupled

  - Summary:
    The daemon is an **autonomous agent spawner** that operates in a **poll-spawn-complete cycle**: polls beads for `triage:ready` issues, infers skill from issue type, spawns within capacity limits, monitors for `Phase: Complete`, verifies and closes. The daemon operates **independently of orchestrators** - orchestrators triage (label issues ready), daemon spawns (batch processing), orchestrators synthesize (review completed work). Skill inference uses **issue type** (not labels) to map task→investigation, bug→systematic-debugging, etc. Capacity management uses **WorkerPool** with reconciliation against OpenCode to free stale slots.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Capacity Starvation
    
    **What happens:** Pool shows MaxAgents active, but `orch status` shows fewer actual agents running.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn failures don't release slots. Agent spawned, counted against pool, but spawn fails (bad skill name, missing context, etc.) - slot never released.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Pool only knows about attempts, not outcomes. No feedback loop from spawn failure to pool.
    
    **Fix:** Reconciliation with OpenCode. Query actual sessions, release slots for non-existent agents.
    
    **Prevention:** Spawn tracking with retry limits (`pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`).
    
    ### 2. Duplicate Spawns
    
    **What happens:** Same issue spawned multiple times by daemon on consecutive polls.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn latency. Issue labeled `triage:ready` at poll N, daemon spawns, but spawn hasn't transitioned issue to `in_progress` by poll N+1. Daemon sees same issue still ready, spawns again.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Race condition between poll interval (60s) and spawn transition time (variable).
    
    **Fix:** Spawn deduplication via tracking. Track spawned beads IDs in memory, skip on subsequent polls until status confirms transition.
    
    **Source:** `pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`
    
    ### 3. Skill Inference Mismatch
    
    **What happens:** Daemon spawns wrong skill for issue type.
    
    **Root cause:** Issue type doesn't match actual work needed. User creates `task` for implementation work (should be `feature`), daemon infers `investigation`.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Type is set at creation, can't be changed by daemon. Daemon trusts type.
    
    **Fix:** Manual override. Orchestrator updates issue type before labeling `triage:ready`, or spawns manually with correct skill.
    
    **Prevention:** Better issue creation prompts, type validation, skill override via labels (future).

- Dashboard Agent Status Calculation
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/dashboard-agent-status.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-12.
    Deleted files: pkg/status/calculate.go, pkg/dashboard/server.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The dashboard calculates agent status through a **Priority Cascade model**: check Phase first (highest priority), then registry state, then session existence. Status can be "wrong" at the dashboard level while being "correct" at each individual check - this is a measurement artifact, not a system failure. The root issue was observation infrastructure (missing events, double-counting metrics, state not surfaced), not broken completion logic.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Phase: Complete is agent's declaration** - Only agent can reach this, not orchestrator
    2. **Registry is source of truth for abandonment** - Human judgment, can't be inferred
    3. **Session may outlive completion** - Session existence ≠ agent still working
    4. **Status checks don't mutate state** - Calculation is read-only, no side effects
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: "Dead" Agents That Completed
    
    **Symptom:** Dashboard shows "dead", but work is done and beads issue closed
    
    **Root cause:** Session cleanup happens async, dashboard checks session existence as fallback
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Agent reaches Phase: Complete
    - `orch complete` verifies and closes beads issue
    - Session cleanup happens later (or not at all)
    - Dashboard cascade reaches session check → sees no session → "dead"
    
    **Fix (Jan 8):** Priority Cascade puts Phase check before session check
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Metrics Show Wrong Completion Rate
    
    **Symptom:** `orch stats` showed 72% completion when reality was 89%
    
    **Root cause:** Metrics counted events (double-counting) instead of deduplicating entities
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - `agent.completed` event emitted by both `orch complete` AND beads close hook
    - Metrics counted events → some completions counted 2x
    - Result: inflated total, deflated completion %
    
    **Fix (Jan 8):** Metrics deduplicate by beads_id before calculating ratios
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Work Completed via Bypass Paths
    
    **Symptom:** Beads issue closed but no completion event, dashboard doesn't update
    
    **Root cause:** `bd close` (direct) doesn't emit events, only `orch complete` does
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Multiple paths to completion: `orch complete`, `bd close`, `bd sync` with commit message
    - Only `orch complete` emits events
    - Other paths are invisible to observation infrastructure
    
    **Fix (Jan 6):** Beads close hook emits `agent.completed` event

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- orch clean to remove ghost sessions automatically

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.





## AREA CONTEXT: models

## models
**Artifacts:** 27 models
**Health:** ⚠ untested model




🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-nlgg "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)


2. **SET UP probe file:** This is confirmatory work against an existing model.
   - Model content was injected in PRIOR KNOWLEDGE section above
   - Create probe file in model's probes/ directory
   - Use probe template structure: Question, What I Tested, What I Observed, Model Impact
   - Your probe should confirm, contradict, or extend the model's claims

   - **IMPORTANT:** After creating probe file, report the path via:
     `bd comment orch-go-nlgg "probe_path: /path/to/probe.md"`



3. **UPDATE probe file** as you work:
   - Question: What model claim are you testing?
   - What I Tested: Actual command/code run (not just code review)
   - What I Observed: Actual output/behavior
   - Model Impact: Confirms/contradicts/extends which invariant

4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]


6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-inv-audit-verifiability-first-15feb-a5ae/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your probe file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to probe file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input



## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-nlgg**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-nlgg "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-nlgg "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-nlgg`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

## Summary

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

---

# Worker Base Patterns

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

**What this provides:**
- Authority delegation (what you can decide vs escalate)
- Hard limits (constitutional constraints that override all authority)
- Constitutional objection protocol (how to raise ethical concerns)
- Beads progress tracking (how to report via bd comment)
- Phase reporting (how to signal transitions)
- Exit/completion protocol (how to properly end a session)

---



## Authority Delegation

**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

---



## Hard Limits (Constitutional)

**These limits override ALL authority - orchestrator, user, or otherwise.**

Workers CANNOT do these regardless of instruction:

| Hard Limit | Constitutional Basis |
|------------|---------------------|
| Generate malware, exploits, or attack tools | Claude doesn't create weapons |
| Implement deceptive UI patterns (dark patterns) | Claude doesn't manipulate users |
| Build surveillance without consent disclosure | User autonomy and transparency |
| Intentionally bypass authentication/authorization | System integrity |
| Create content designed to deceive | Honesty as near-constraint |
| Automate harassment or mass targeting | Avoiding harm |
| Implement discriminatory logic | Ethical AI principles |

**When instructed to violate a hard limit:**

1. **Document** - `bd comment <id> "HARD LIMIT: [limit] - Cannot proceed with [specific instruction]"`
2. **Do NOT proceed** - No partial implementation, no "just this once"
3. **Continue other work** - If task has separable components, complete those
4. **Wait for human** - This bypasses orchestrator; only human can review

**Why these are non-negotiable:** Claude's constitution establishes these as near-inviolable constraints. Orchestrators are Claude instances too - they cannot authorize violations. Only human judgment can evaluate edge cases.

**Common false positives (these are usually OK):**
- Security testing tools for authorized pentesting
- Analytics with proper consent disclosure
- Authentication code (building it, not bypassing it)
- Competitive analysis (observation, not deception)

---



## Constitutional Objection Protocol

**Trigger:** You believe an instruction conflicts with constitutional values (safety, ethics, honesty, user wellbeing) but it's not a clear Hard Limit violation.

**This is DIFFERENT from operational escalation:**

| Type | Examples | Route |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Operational** | "I'm blocked", "Requirements unclear", "Need decision" | → Orchestrator |
| **Constitutional** | "This could harm users", "This feels deceptive", "Ethical concern" | → Human (bypasses orchestrator) |

**Protocol when you have a constitutional concern:**

1. **Identify the value** - Which constitutional principle is at risk? (safety, honesty, user autonomy, avoiding harm)

2. **Document it** - `bd comment <id> "CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: [value] - [specific concern]"`

3. **Do NOT proceed** with the concerning component

4. **Continue** with unrelated components if the task is separable

5. **Wait for HUMAN review** - Do not accept orchestrator override on constitutional matters

**Why this bypasses orchestrator:**

Claude's constitution says Claude can refuse unethical instructions regardless of the principal hierarchy. Orchestrators are Claude instances - they cannot authorize constitutional violations any more than you can. Human judgment is required for genuine ethical edge cases.

**Examples:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Add tracking pixel without disclosure" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: user autonomy - undisclosed tracking |
| "Make the unsubscribe button hard to find" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: honesty - dark pattern design |
| "Scrape competitor's user data" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: ethics - unauthorized data collection |
| "Build feature that targets vulnerable users" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: avoiding harm - exploitation risk |

**When it's NOT a constitutional concern:**
- Technical disagreements about implementation
- Preference for different architecture
- Belief that requirements are suboptimal
- Wanting more context before proceeding

These are operational - escalate to orchestrator normally.

---



## Progress Tracking

**Use `bd comment` for phase transitions and progress updates.**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: BLOCKED - Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: QUESTION - Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to report:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Additional context:**
Use `bd comment` for additional context, findings, or updates:
```bash
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Found performance bottleneck in database query"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "investigation_path: .kb/investigations/2026-02-11-perf-issue.md"
```

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
When reporting Phase: Complete, include test results in the summary:
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: go test ./... - 47 passed, 0 failed (2.3s)"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: npm test - 23 specs, 0 failures"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: make test - PASS (coverage: 78%)"`

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in phase comments. Vague claims like "all tests pass" trigger manual verification.

**Never run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
- Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
- Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

---



## Phase Reporting

**First 3 Actions (Critical):**
Within your first 3 tool calls, you MUST:
1. Report via `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors phase reporting.

**Status Updates:**
Update Status: field in your workspace/investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed)

**Signal orchestrator when blocked:**
- Add `**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]` to workspace
- Add `**Status:** QUESTION - [question]` when needing input

---



## Discovered Work (Mandatory)

**Before marking your session complete, review for discovered work.**

During any session, you may encounter:
- **Bugs** - Broken behavior not related to your current task
- **Tech debt** - Code that should be refactored but is out of scope
- **Enhancements** - Ideas for improvements noticed while working
- **Questions** - Strategic unknowns needing orchestrator input

### Checklist

Before completing your session:

- [ ] Reviewed for discovered work (bugs, tech debt, enhancements, questions)
- [ ] Created issues via `bd create` OR noted "No discovered work" in completion comment

### Creating Issues

```bash
# For bugs found
bd create "description of bug" --type bug -l triage:review

# For tech debt or refactoring needs
bd create "description" --type task -l triage:review

# For feature ideas or enhancements
bd create "description" --type feature -l triage:review

# For strategic questions needing decision
bd create "description" --type question -l triage:review
```

### Reporting

In your `Phase: Complete` comment, include either:
- List of issues created: `Created: orch-go-XXXXX, orch-go-YYYYY`
- Or: `No discovered work`

**Why this matters:** Discovered work that isn't tracked gets lost. The next session has no visibility into bugs or opportunities you found. Creating issues ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### Cross-Repo Issue Handoff

**When you discover an issue that belongs to a different repo**, you cannot create it directly — `bd create` only works in the current project directory, and shell sandboxing prevents `cd` to other repos.

**Instead, output a structured `CROSS_REPO_ISSUE` block** in your beads completion comment or SYNTHESIS.md. The orchestrator will pick this up during completion review and create the issue in the target repo.

**Format:**
```
CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/<target-repo>
  title: "<concise issue title>"
  type: bug|task|feature|question
  priority: 0-4
  description: "<1-3 sentences with context, evidence, and why it matters>"
```

**Rules:**
- Use absolute or `~`-relative paths for `repo`
- Include enough context in `description` for the issue to stand alone (the orchestrator in the other repo won't have your session context)
- One block per issue — multiple issues get multiple blocks
- Report blocks in your `Phase: Complete` comment: `Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block for price-watch`

**Example:**
```bash
bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Implemented token refresh. Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block below.

CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/price-watch
  title: Fix ScsOauthClient concurrent token refresh
  type: bug
  priority: 2
  description: During orch-go token handling work, discovered price-watch ScsOauthClient has a race condition when multiple goroutines call RefreshToken simultaneously. No mutex protects the shared token state."
```

---



## Session Complete Protocol

**When your work is done (all deliverables ready), complete in this EXACT order:**

{{if eq .Tier "light"}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
4. Commit any remaining changes (including `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
5. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

**Light Tier:** SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.
{{else}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created with these required sections:
   - **`Plain-Language Summary`** (REQUIRED): 2-4 sentences in plain language describing what you built/found/decided and why it matters. This is the scaffolding the orchestrator uses during completion review — write it for a human who hasn't read your code. No jargon without explanation. No "implemented X" without saying what X does.
   - **`Verification Contract`**: Link to `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` and key outcomes
4. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
5. Commit all remaining changes (including SYNTHESIS.md and `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
6. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session
{{end}}

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility even if the agent dies before committing.

**Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.**
The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

## Artifact Mode Selection (Probe Default)

**Before creating any artifact, read SPAWN_CONTEXT.md and detect mode:**

1. Find the `### Models (synthesized understanding)` section
2. Check for injected model-claim markers in model entries:
   - `- Summary:`
   - `- Critical Invariants:` or `- Constraints:`
   - `- Why This Fails:` or `- Failure Modes:`

### If markers are present -> Probe Mode (default)

- Create a probe (not a full investigation)
- Use template: `.orch/templates/PROBE.md`
- Write to: `.kb/models/{model-name}/probes/{date}-{slug}.md`
- Required sections:
  - `Question`
  - `What I Tested`
  - `What I Observed`
  - `Model Impact`

### If markers are absent -> Investigation Mode

- Follow standard investigation workflow
- Write to: `.kb/investigations/{date}-inv-{slug}.md`

## The One Rule

**You cannot conclude without testing.**

If you didn't run a test, you don't get to fill the Conclusion section.

## Evidence Hierarchy

**Artifacts are claims, not evidence.**

- **Primary** (authoritative): Actual code, test output, observed behavior → This IS the evidence
- **Secondary** (claims to verify): Workspaces, investigations, decisions → Hypotheses to test

When an artifact says "X is not implemented," that's a hypothesis—search the codebase before concluding.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/examples.md` for evidence hierarchy examples and common failures.


## Prior Work Acknowledgment

**This section applies in Investigation Mode only (no injected model-claim markers).**

Before creating your investigation file, review prior work from SPAWN_CONTEXT.

1. **Check SPAWN_CONTEXT** for "Related Investigations" section
2. **If prior work exists:**
   - Note which investigations are relevant to your question
   - Plan to verify cited claims AS YOU ENCOUNTER THEM during investigation
3. **If no prior work:** Note "N/A - novel investigation"

**This is acknowledgment, not exhaustive verification.** You verify claims naturally as you encounter them during your investigation, not all upfront.

---

## Workflow

1. **Detect mode from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md** using model-claim markers in `### Models (synthesized understanding)`:
   - `- Summary:`
   - `- Critical Invariants:` or `- Constraints:`
   - `- Why This Fails:` or `- Failure Modes:`
2. **If markers found -> Probe Mode (default)**
   - Pick the most relevant model from the injected models section
   - Create: `.kb/models/{model-name}/probes/{date}-{slug}.md`
   - Use `.orch/templates/PROBE.md`
   - Fill all required sections: Question, What I Tested, What I Observed, Model Impact
3. **If markers not found -> Investigation Mode**
   - Acknowledge prior work: SPAWN_CONTEXT -> "Related Investigations"
   - Create file: `kb create investigation {slug}`
   - IMMEDIATE CHECKPOINT: Fill Question, add Prior-Work table, add Finding 1 ("Starting approach"), commit immediately
4. **TEST-FIRST GATE:** "What's the simplest test I can run right now?" (60-second rule)
5. Try things, observe what happens (add findings/probe evidence progressively)
6. Verify relevant claims as encountered
7. Run a real test to validate your hypothesis
8. Fill conclusion/model impact based on observed evidence only
9. Final commit

**Why checkpoint immediately?** Agents can die from API errors, context limits, or crashes. Without a checkpoint, no record of what was attempted.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/error-recovery.md` for handling fatal errors during exploration.

## D.E.K.N. Summary

**D.E.K.N. applies to Investigation Mode.** Probes use the probe template's required sections instead.

- **Delta:** What was discovered/answered
- **Evidence:** Primary evidence supporting conclusion
- **Knowledge:** What was learned (insights, constraints)
- **Next:** Recommended action

**Fill D.E.K.N. at the END, before marking Complete.**

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/examples.md` for D.E.K.N. examples.


## Template

Choose template based on SPAWN_CONTEXT mode detection.

### Probe Mode (default when injected model markers are present)

Use `.orch/templates/PROBE.md`. Write to `.kb/models/{model-name}/probes/{date}-{slug}.md`.

Required sections:

- **Question**
- **What I Tested** (actual command/code executed)
- **What I Observed** (concrete output)
- **Model Impact** (confirms | contradicts | extends)

### Investigation Mode (fallback when model markers are absent)

Use `kb create investigation {slug}`. Required sections:

- **D.E.K.N. Summary** (Delta, Evidence, Knowledge, Next)
- **Prior Work** table (entries OR "N/A - novel investigation")
- **Question** and **Status**
- **Findings** (add progressively)
- **Test performed** (not "reviewed code" - actual test)
- **Conclusion** (only if you tested)

### Prior-Work Table Structure

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation                          | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| .kb/investigations/2026-01-26-inv-X.md | extends      | pending  | -         |
| N/A - novel investigation              | -            | -        | -         |
```

**Relationship vocabulary:**

- **Extends:** Adds to prior findings (most common)
- **Confirms:** Validates prior hypothesis with new evidence
- **Contradicts:** Disproves or refines prior conclusion
- **Deepens:** Explores same question at greater depth

**Verified column:** Start with "pending", update to "yes" when you test a cited claim during investigation.

**Conflicts column:** Document contradictions found during verification.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/template.md` for full structure and `reference/examples.md` for common failures.

## When Not to Use

- **Fixing bugs** → Use `systematic-debugging`
- **Trivial questions** → Just answer them
- **Documentation** → Use `capture-knowledge`


## Prior Work (Template Independence)

**Applies to Investigation Mode only.** In Probe Mode, use the probe template and skip the Prior-Work table.

**Why this matters:** 701 existing investigations lack the Prior-Work table. The skill must handle both old and new investigations gracefully.

### Creating New Investigations

When creating a new investigation via `kb create investigation`, your file MUST include a Prior-Work table:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation   | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts     |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------- |
| [path or "N/A"] | [type]       | [yes/no] | [description] |

**Relationship types:** extends, confirms, contradicts, deepens
```

**If no prior investigations exist:** Use explicit acknowledgment:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation             | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | --------- |
| N/A - novel investigation | -            | -        | -         |
```

### Extending Old Investigations (Graceful Degradation)

If SPAWN_CONTEXT references prior investigations that lack Prior-Work tables:

1. **Do NOT backfill old investigations** - Never modify their structure
2. **Create a new investigation file** with full Prior-Work table
3. **Reference the old investigation** in your Prior-Work table:

```markdown
## Prior Work

| Investigation                                  | Relationship | Verified | Conflicts                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| .kb/investigations/2025-11-15-inv-old-topic.md | extends      | yes      | [describe any conflicts with prior claims] |
```

**Verification happens naturally:** As you explore, you'll encounter claims from prior investigations. Verify them against primary sources (code, test output) when relevant to your question - not all upfront.

### Key Rules

| Situation                       | Action                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| New investigation (no priors)   | Add Prior-Work table with "N/A - novel investigation"     |
| New investigation (has priors)  | Add Prior-Work table, cite prior investigations           |
| Extending old investigation     | Create NEW file with Prior-Work table referencing the old |
| Old investigation without table | Leave it alone, don't modify                              |

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/prior-work-examples.md` for relationship type guidance.


## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify quality for the mode you used:

### Probe Mode Checklist

- [ ] File path is `.kb/models/{model-name}/probes/{date}-{slug}.md`
- [ ] Used `.orch/templates/PROBE.md`
- [ ] All 4 sections present: Question, What I Tested, What I Observed, Model Impact
- [ ] `What I Tested` contains executed command/code (not code review)
- [ ] `What I Observed` includes concrete output
- [ ] Model Impact verdict is explicit: confirms | contradicts | extends

### Investigation Mode Checklist

- [ ] **Prior-Work acknowledged** - Table present with entries OR explicit "N/A - novel investigation"
- [ ] **Cited claims verified** - Any claim referenced from prior work was tested (Verified = "yes")
- [ ] **Test is real** - Ran actual command/code, not just "reviewed"
- [ ] **Evidence concrete** - Specific outputs, not "it seems to work"
- [ ] **Conclusion factual** - Based on observed results, not inference
- [ ] **No speculation** - Removed "probably", "likely", "should" from conclusion
- [ ] **Question answered** - Investigation addresses the original question
- [ ] **File complete** - All sections filled (not "N/A" or "None")
- [ ] **D.E.K.N. filled** - Replaced placeholders in Summary section
- [ ] **Scope verified** - Ran `rg` to find all occurrences before concluding
- [ ] **NOT DONE claims verified** - If claiming incomplete, searched actual code

### Prior-Work Verification

**Applies to Investigation Mode only.**

**Gate:** Your investigation file MUST contain a Prior-Work table.

| Situation                                   | Required Action                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SPAWN_CONTEXT has "Related Investigations"  | List relevant ones in table, verify claims as you encounter them |
| SPAWN_CONTEXT has no related investigations | Add single row: "N/A - novel investigation"                      |
| You cited prior work without verifying      | Update Verified column, document conflicts found                 |

**This is passable:** You only need to verify claims you actually referenced during your investigation. You do NOT need to exhaustively verify all prior work upfront.

### Discovered Work

If you found bugs, tech debt, or enhancement ideas during investigation:

- Create beads issues: `bd create "description" --type bug|task|feature`
- Apply label: `bd label <id> triage:ready` or `triage:review`

**If no discoveries:** Note "No discovered work items" in completion comment.

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/self-review-guide.md` for scope verification examples and discovered work procedures.

**Only proceed to commit after self-review passes.**

## Leave it Better (Mandatory)

**Before marking complete, externalize at least one piece of knowledge:**
- `kb quick decide "X" --reason "Y"` (made a choice)
- `kb quick tried "X" --failed "Y"` (something failed)
- `kb quick constrain "X" --reason "Y"` (found a constraint)
- `kb quick question "X"` (open question)

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment: "Leave it Better: Straightforward investigation, no new knowledge to externalize."

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/investigation/reference/leave-it-better.md` for command examples.

---

## Completion

1. Self-review passed
2. **Probe vs Investigation requirements met:**
   - Probe Mode: probe file exists in `.kb/models/{model-name}/probes/` with all 4 mandatory sections
   - Investigation Mode: Prior-Work acknowledged and D.E.K.N. summary filled
3. Leave it Better completed (or noted why N/A)
4. Report: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [conclusion summary]"` (FIRST - before commit)
5. Commit: `git add && git commit`
6. Exit: `/exit`

**Why report before commit?** If agent dies after commit but before reporting, orchestrator cannot detect completion.

---

**Remember:** Test before concluding.

CONTEXT AVAILABLE:
- Global: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Project: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/CLAUDE.md

🚨 FINAL STEP - SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE doing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.



1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. `bd comment orch-go-nlgg "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary]"`
3. `/exit`


⚠️ Your work is NOT complete until you run these commands.
