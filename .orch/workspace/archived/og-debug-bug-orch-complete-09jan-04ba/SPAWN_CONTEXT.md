TASK: Bug: orch complete doesn't set OpenCode session status to 'done'. After completion, session remains 'null' causing ghost agents in status. Need to call OpenCode API to update session status.

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "bug"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Untracked spawns (--no-track) generate placeholder beads IDs that fail bd comment commands
  - Reason: Beads IDs like orch-go-untracked-* don't exist in database, causing bd comment to fail with 'issue not found' - this is expected behavior, not a bug
- High patch density in a single area (5+ fix commits, 10+ conditions, duplicate logic) signals missing coherent model - spawn architect before more patches
  - Reason: Dashboard status logic accumulated 10+ conditions from incremental agent patches without anyone stepping back to design. Each patch was locally correct but globally incoherent. Discovered Jan 4 2026 after weeks of completion bugs.
- force flags should not bypass substantive gates only procedural checks
  - Reason: Bug fix orch-go-599i showed --force was bypassing repro verification. Substantive gates require explicit bypass flags with reasons.
- Untracked spawns (--no-track) generate placeholder beads IDs that fail bd comment commands
  - Reason: Beads IDs like orch-go-untracked-* don't exist in database, causing bd comment to fail with 'issue not found' - this is expected behavior, not a bug
- UI features require browser verification before marking complete
  - Reason: Post-mortem og-work-dashboard-two-modes-27dec: SSR hydration bug passed build/typecheck but failed in browser; agent documented 'not browser-tested' but had no gate to force validation

### Prior Decisions
- Cross-project epics use Option A: epic in primary repo, ad-hoc spawns with --no-track in secondary repos, manual bd close with commit refs
  - Reason: Only working pattern today. Beads multi-repo hydration is read-only aggregation, bd repo commands are buggy.
- orch complete auto-closes tmux window after successful verification
  - Reason: Complete means done - window goes away, beads closes, workspace remains. Prevents phantom accumulation (41 windows today). Debugging escape hatch: don't complete until ready to close.
- Beads multi-repo hydration works correctly in v0.33.2
  - Reason: Config disconnect bug fixed in commit 634c0b93. Prior kn entry about 'buggy v0.29.0' is superseded.
- Dashboard should use progressive disclosure (Active/Recent/Archive sections) for session management
  - Reason: Balances operational visibility (active work always visible) with historical debugging (expand sections as needed) and UI clarity (collapsed sections reduce clutter). Only approach that satisfies all three user contexts: development focus, debugging history, and health monitoring.

- System resource visibility not needed in orchestrator
  - Reason: External monitoring (sketchybar) already provides CPU/memory visibility; high resource usage in orch processes indicates bugs to fix, not normal states to monitor
- snap CLI for debugging capture, Playwright MCP for web validation
  - Reason: Web validation requires browser control (navigate, wait, interact) before capture - snap only provides capture

## REPRODUCTION (BUG FIX)

🐛 **This is a bug fix issue.** The fix is verified when the reproduction steps no longer produce the bug.

**Original Reproduction:**
After orch complete successfully verifies and closes an agent, the OpenCode session status remains 'null' instead of being set to 'done'. This causes completed agents to appear as 'running' in orch status output.

Root cause: cmd/orch/complete_cmd.go doesn't call OpenCode API to update session status after completion.

Impact:
- Completed agents appear in 'orch status' as running
- Ghost agents accumulate in the active list
- Token counters remain visible for completed work
- Confusing user experience (like pw-oicj appearing with 1.1M tokens after completion)

Expected behavior:
- After orch complete succeeds, call OpenCode API to set session status to 'done'
- orch status should then filter out completed sessions

Investigation: .kb/investigations/2026-01-09-inv-pw-oicj-ghost-agent-postmortem.md

**Verification Requirement:**
Before marking Phase: Complete, you MUST:
1. Attempt to reproduce the original bug using the steps above
2. Confirm the bug NO LONGER reproduces after your fix
3. Report verification via: `bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Reproduction verified: [describe test performed]"`

⚠️ A bug fix is only complete when the original reproduction steps pass.


🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-hknqq "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation bug-orch-complete-doesn-set` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-orch-complete-doesn-set.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

   - **IMPORTANT:** After running `kb create`, report the actual path via:
     `bd comment orch-go-hknqq "investigation_path: /path/to/file.md"`
     (This allows orch complete to verify the correct file)

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-debug-bug-orch-complete-09jan-04ba/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input


## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-hknqq**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-hknqq "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-hknqq "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-hknqq "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-hknqq`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

# Systematic Debugging

## Summary

Four-phase debugging framework: Root Cause → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation. Core principle: understand before fixing.

---

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

---

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, production bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- Previous fixes didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

---

## Quick Reference

1. Check if specialized technique applies (see patterns section)
2. Check console/logs for errors - error may already be captured
3. Phase 1: Root cause investigation (understand WHAT and WHY)
4. Phase 2: Pattern analysis (working vs broken differences)
5. Phase 3: Hypothesis testing (form and test specific theory)
6. Phase 4: Implementation (failing test, fix root cause, verify)
7. Document and complete

**Red flag:** If thinking "quick fix for now" → STOP, return to Phase 1.


## Error Visibility (BEFORE Phase 1)

Check if errors have already been logged before investigating:

```bash
# Check project-specific error logs
tail -50 *.log 2>/dev/null
# Check build/test output
make test 2>&1 | tail -30
# Check runtime logs (if applicable)
docker logs <container> --tail 50 2>/dev/null
```

**If logs show relevant errors:**
1. Copy error details to investigation file
2. Use as starting point for Phase 1
3. You may already have root cause evidence

**If empty or unhelpful:** Proceed to Phase 1.

---

## Common Debugging Patterns

Before starting Phase 1, identify if a specialized technique applies:

| Pattern | Symptoms | Technique |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Deep call stack** | Error deep in execution, origin unclear, data corruption propagated | [techniques/root-cause-tracing.md](techniques/root-cause-tracing.md) |
| **Timing-dependent** | Flaky tests, race conditions, arbitrary timeouts, "works locally fails in CI" | [techniques/condition-based-waiting.md](techniques/condition-based-waiting.md) |
| **Invalid data propagation** | Bad data causes failures far from source, missing validation | [techniques/defense-in-depth.md](techniques/defense-in-depth.md) |

Load the appropriate technique for specialized guidance.


## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**Goal:** Understand WHAT and WHY

**Load:** [phases/phase1-root-cause.md](phases/phase1-root-cause.md)

Key activities:
- Read error messages carefully (stack traces completely)
- Reproduce consistently
- Check recent changes AND pattern recognition (whack-a-mole detection)
- In multi-component systems: add diagnostic instrumentation before fixing
- Trace data flow to source

**Success criteria:** You understand root cause, not just symptoms

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Goal:** Identify differences between working and broken

**Load:** [phases/phase2-pattern-analysis.md](phases/phase2-pattern-analysis.md)

Key activities:
- Find working examples in same codebase
- Read reference implementations COMPLETELY (don't skim)
- List every difference, however small
- Understand dependencies and assumptions

**Success criteria:** You know what's different and why it matters

---

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Goal:** Form and test specific hypothesis

**Load:** [phases/phase3-hypothesis-testing.md](phases/phase3-hypothesis-testing.md)

Key activities:
- Form single hypothesis: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
- Test minimally (one variable at a time)
- Verify before continuing - didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis, don't add more fixes

**Success criteria:** Hypothesis confirmed or new hypothesis formed

---

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Goal:** Fix root cause, not symptom

**Load:** [phases/phase4-implementation.md](phases/phase4-implementation.md)

Key activities:
- Create failing test case
- Implement single fix
- **Smoke-test end-to-end** (critical - see below)
- If 3+ fixes failed: question architecture

**Success criteria:** Bug resolved, tests pass, smoke-test confirms real fix

---

## Smoke-Test Requirement

**Before claiming fix is complete, you MUST:**
1. Run the actual failing scenario that triggered debugging
2. Verify expected behavior now occurs
3. Document smoke-test in completion comment

**Valid:** "Bug: CLI crashes on --mcp" → Run `orch spawn --mcp`, verify no crash
**Invalid:** "Unit tests pass" (necessary but not sufficient)

**If cannot smoke-test:** Document WHY in completion comment.


## Visual Debugging Tools

### snap - Screenshot CLI (Recommended)

```bash
snap                          # Capture screen, returns file path
snap list --json              # Find window IDs
snap window "Firefox"         # Capture by app name
snap --json                   # JSON output: {"path": "/path/to/screenshot.png"}
```

**Use for:** Verifying UI state, documenting visual bugs, smoke-testing UI changes.

**Advantage:** Zero context cost (returns file path, not image data).

### Browser Automation

**USE:** Playwright MCP - lighter weight, focused on automation

**AVOID:** browser-use MCP - causes context explosion (screenshots, full DOM)

**Decision flow:**
1. Need visual verification? → `snap`
2. Need browser automation (clicking, typing)? → Playwright MCP
3. Need visual + automation? → Consider if truly necessary


## Investigation File (Optional for Simple Bugs)

Investigation files are **recommended** for complex bugs but **optional** for simple fixes.

### When to Create

**Create when:**
- Multi-step root cause analysis needed
- Multiple hypotheses to test
- Findings should be preserved
- Pattern may recur (for synthesis)

**Skip when:**
- Bug is obvious and localized (typo, wrong variable)
- Fix completes in <15 minutes
- Root cause immediately clear from error
- Commit message can fully document fix

### Create Template (if needed)

```bash
kb create investigation "debug/topic-in-kebab-case"
```

**After creating:**
1. Fill Question field with specific bug description
2. Document findings progressively during Phases 1-4
3. Update Confidence and Resolution-Status as you progress
4. Set Resolution-Status when complete (Resolved/Mitigated/Recurring)

### Commits-Only Completion

If skipping investigation file, ensure descriptive commits:
- Include "why" not just "what"
- Example: `fix: handle null session in auth middleware - was causing silent failures when Redis connection dropped`


## Self-Review (Mandatory)

After implementing fix, perform self-review before completion.

### Pattern Scope Verification

**If bug was a pattern that could exist elsewhere:**

```bash
# Check for pattern occurrences
rg "bug_pattern"                    # Should be 0 or documented exceptions
rg "range\(len\(" --type py         # Off-by-one example
rg "timeout.*=.*[0-9]" --type py    # Hardcoded timeout example
```

**Skip if:** Bug was truly one-off (typo, unique logic error).

### Debugging-Specific Checks

| Check | If Failed |
|-------|-----------|
| Root cause addressed (not symptom) | Return to Phase 1 |
| No debug code left (console.log, print) | Remove before commit |
| No temporary workarounds ("TODO: fix properly") | Complete the fix |
| Regression test exists | Add test |
| Investigation documented | Update file |

### Standard Checks

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Conventional commit format (`fix:`, `test:`)
- [ ] Atomic commits

### Discovered Work

If you found related bugs, tech debt, or systemic issues:

```bash
bd create "description" --type bug    # or --type task
bd label <id> triage:ready           # or triage:review
```

**Note "No discovered work" in completion if nothing found.**

### Report via Beads

```bash
# If issues found and fixed:
bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review: Fixed [issue summary]"

# If passed:
bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"
```


## Fix-Verify-Fix Cycle (Atomic Debugging)

**Fix + Verify = One Unit of Work**

Do NOT:
- Implement fix → claim complete → wait for new spawn if fails
- "Fix is done, verification is a separate task"

DO:
- Implement fix → verify immediately → if fails, iterate
- Only claim complete when smoke-test passes

### When to Iterate vs Escalate

**Keep iterating if:**
- Verification reveals related issue in same area
- Fix was incomplete but direction correct
- You understand why it failed

**Escalate if:**
- 3+ fix attempts failed (questioning architecture needed)
- Root cause was misidentified (return to Phase 1)
- Issue outside your scope/authority

### Reporting During Iteration

```bash
bd comment <beads-id> "Fix attempt 1: [what tried] - Result: [pass/fail + why]"
bd comment <beads-id> "Fix attempt 2: [refined approach] - Result: [pass/fail]"
# Only when actually working:
bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Fix verified via [smoke-test description]"
```

---

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place

**ALL mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**


## Completion Criteria

Before marking complete, verify ALL:

- [ ] **Root cause identified** - Documented in investigation OR commit message
- [ ] **Fix implemented** - Addresses root cause, not symptoms
- [ ] **Tests passing** - Including reproduction test, with **actual test output documented**
- [ ] **Smoke-test passed** - Actual failing scenario now works
- [ ] **Self-review passed** - Pattern scope, no debug code, no workarounds
- [ ] **Discovered work reviewed** - Tracked or noted "No discoveries"
- [ ] **Phase reported with test evidence** - `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Tests: <cmd> - <output>"` (BEFORE final commit)
- [ ] **Git clean** - `git status` shows "nothing to commit"

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

### After All Criteria Met (in this EXACT order)

```bash
# 1. Report phase FIRST (before commit) - prevents agent death race condition
# Include ACTUAL test output, not just "tests passing"
bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Root cause: [X], Fix: [Y], Tests: go test ./... - 23 passed, 0 failed"

# 2. Commit any final changes
git add . && git commit -m "fix: [description]"

# 3. Exit
/exit
```

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
- Format: `Tests: <command> - <actual output summary>`
- Good: `Tests: go test ./... - 23 passed, 0 failed`
- Good: `Tests: npm test - 15 specs, 0 failures`
- Bad: `Tests passing` (no command, no numbers)

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in comments. Vague claims trigger manual verification.

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility.

**Note:** `bd close` is removed from agent responsibilities - only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.

---

## Fast-Path Alternative

For clearly localized, trivial failures (import path error, undefined name, obvious single-file fix):

Use `quick-debugging` skill instead. It provides lightweight loop with strict escalation back to systematic-debugging if first attempt fails.

**Use quick-debugging when:**
- Scope ≤ 2 files and ≤ 1 hour
- Error points directly at fix location
- No architectural uncertainty

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question architecture, return to Phase 1.
