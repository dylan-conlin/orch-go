TASK: test session id capture

SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "test"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- External integrations require manual smoke test before Phase: Complete
  - Reason: OAuth feature shipped with passing tests but failed real-world use. Tests couldn't cover actual OAuth flow with Anthropic.
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification
- Build artifacts should not be committed at project root
  - Reason: Development executables (orch-*, test-*) clutter the directory and waste space (~75MB+)
- Agents modifying web/ files MUST capture visual verification via Playwright MCP before completing
  - Reason: Tests passing does not verify UI renders correctly. Prior instances of UI features shipping with broken rendering despite passing tests.
- UI features require browser verification before marking complete
  - Reason: Post-mortem og-work-dashboard-two-modes-27dec: SSR hydration bug passed build/typecheck but failed in browser; agent documented 'not browser-tested' but had no gate to force validation

### Prior Decisions
- Refactor shell-out functions for testability
  - Reason: Extracting command construction into Build*Command functions allows unit testing of logic without side effects
- VerifyCompletion relies on latest beads comment
  - Reason: Ensures current state is validated
- Temporal density and repeated constraints are highest value reflection signals
  - Reason: Low noise, high actionability - tested against real kn/kb data
- Constraint validity tested by implementation, not age
  - Reason: Constraints become outdated when code contradicts them (implementation supersession), not when time passes. Test with rg before assuming constraint holds.
- Confidence scores in investigations are noise, not signal
  - Reason: Nov 2025 Codex case: 5 investigations at High/Very High confidence all reached wrong conclusions. Current distribution: 90% cluster at 85-95%, providing no discriminative value. Recommendation: Replace with structured uncertainty (tested/untested enumeration).
- Tmux is the default spawn mode in orch-go, not headless
  - Reason: Testing and code inspection confirmed tmux is default (main.go:1042), CLAUDE.md documentation was incorrect
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.
- UI changes in web/ require visual verification via Playwright MCP screenshot
  - Reason: Tests passing does not guarantee UI renders correctly. Visual evidence ensures feature works as intended.
- SHOULD-HOW-EXECUTE sequence for strategic questions
  - Reason: Epic orch-go-erdw was created from 'how do we' without testing premise. Architect found premise wrong. Wasted work avoided if 'should we' asked first.
- Use direct fetch in page.evaluate to test API performance
  - Reason: Bypasses SSE connection requirement while still testing the mock API response time
- Integration tests should use t.Skip when daemon not available
  - Reason: Allows tests to pass in CI or environments without beads daemon
- Use snap for simple visual verification, Playwright MCP for complex UI testing
  - Reason: Playwright MCP tool definitions cost ~5-10k tokens. For basic 'take screenshot' verification in feature-impl, snap CLI is sufficient and nearly zero token cost. Reserve Playwright for: automated assertions, headless CI, complex interactions.
- Auto-detect CLI commands feature was already complete
  - Reason: Found detectNewCLICommands at main.go:3082-3150 with tests passing - no additional work needed
- Test design knowledge accumulation on orch-go dashboard
  - Reason: Low baseline knowledge, existing skill to build on, real project, fast feedback loop. Capture design friction via kn entries, see if patterns emerge and promote to principles.

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference investigations for prior findings.





📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation test-session-id-capture` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-test-session-id-capture.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-test-session-id-06jan-9bc1/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.
