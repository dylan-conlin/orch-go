TASK: Rethink orch spawn flag semantics — model, backend, and visibility are conflated.

## Problem
Current flags conflate independent concerns:
- `--opus` implies model (opus) + backend (claude) + visibility (tmux) — three axes collapsed into one flag
- `--mode`/`--backend` auto-detection overrides explicit user flags (infrastructure keyword detection forces claude backend, can't be overridden)
- No way to express 'opencode backend + opus model' or 'force opencode for infrastructure work'
- `--tmux` conflates visibility with backend selection

## Axes that should be independent
1. **Model** — what LLM to use (opus/sonnet/flash/pro)
2. **Backend** — how to run the session (opencode API / claude CLI)
3. **Visibility** — how to observe it (headless / tmux / inline)
4. **Auto-overrides** — infrastructure escape hatch should be advisory, not mandatory

## Concrete pain point
When verifying a fix to OpenCode's SessionProcessor (orch-go-1nh7), we needed to spawn an agent through OpenCode to exercise the fixed code path. All 3 attempts auto-overrode to claude backend because the task description mentioned 'OpenCode' and 'server'. Even explicit `--mode opencode` was overridden.

## PROJECT_DIR: ~/Documents/personal/orch-go
## SESSION SCOPE: Medium

### IN scope
- Audit current flag semantics and interactions (spawn_cmd.go, spawn config)
- Propose clean orthogonal flag design
- Consider backwards compatibility / migration
- Address the auto-override escape hatch behavior

### OUT of scope
- Implementation (this is design only)
- Daemon spawn path changes (focus on CLI `orch spawn`)
- Skill system changes

### Authority
- You DECIDE: flag naming, semantic grouping, default behaviors
- You ESCALATE: if proposal requires breaking changes to daemon integration

### Deliverables
- SYNTHESIS.md with:
  - Current flag audit (what exists, what each does, where they conflate)
  - Proposed flag design (orthogonal axes)
  - Migration path from current → proposed
  - Recommendation on auto-override behavior

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "rethink orch spawn"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- orch tail tmux fallback requires either current registry window ID OR beads ID in window name format [beads-id]
  - Reason: Dual-dependency failure causes fallback to fail when both are stale/missing
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- orch complete must verify SYNTHESIS.md exists and is not placeholder before closing issue
  - Reason: 70% of agents completed without synthesis in 24h chaos period
- orch init must be idempotent - safe to run multiple times
  - Reason: Prevents accidental overwrites and enables 'run init to update' pattern
- orch status can show phantom agents (tmux windows where OpenCode exited)
  - Reason: No reconciliation between tmux liveness and OpenCode session state
- orch status counts ALL workers-* tmux windows as active
  - Reason: Discovered during phantom agent investigation - status inflated by persistent windows
- Untracked spawns (--no-track) generate placeholder beads IDs that fail bd comment commands
  - Reason: Beads IDs like orch-go-untracked-* don't exist in database, causing bd comment to fail with 'issue not found' - this is expected behavior, not a bug
- Worker spawns must set ORCH_WORKER=1 to skip orchestrator skill loading
  - Reason: Orchestrator skill (1,251 lines ~37k tokens) is auto-loaded by session-context plugin for all orch projects but is unnecessary for worker sessions, wastes context budget
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification
- kb context command hangs on some queries
  - Reason: Blocks orch spawn from returning, use --skip-artifact-check as workaround

### Prior Decisions
- orch-go tmux spawn is fire-and-forget - no session ID capture
  - Reason: opencode run --attach is TUI-based; --format json gives session ID but loses TUI. Accept title-matching via orch status for monitoring.
- Headless Swarm = batch execution + rate-limit management across accounts
  - Reason: User clarified scope: focus on concurrent agent spawning with capacity management, not distributed architecture or multi-model routing
- Registry updates must happen before beads close in orch complete
  - Reason: Prevents inconsistent state where beads shows closed but registry shows active
- orch spawn context delivery is reliable
  - Reason: Verified that SPAWN_CONTEXT.md is correctly populated and accessible by the agent
- orch-go CLI independence
  - Reason: CLI commands connect directly to OpenCode (4096), not orch serve (3333)
- Multi-agent synthesis relies on workspace isolation + SYNTHESIS.md + orch review
  - Reason: 100 commits, 52 synthesis files, 0 conflicts validates current architecture
- Cross-project epics use Option A: epic in primary repo, ad-hoc spawns with --no-track in secondary repos, manual bd close with commit refs
  - Reason: Only working pattern today. Beads multi-repo hydration is read-only aggregation, bd repo commands are buggy.
- Beads OSS: Clean Slate over Fork
  - Reason: Local features (ai-help, health, tree) not used by orch ecosystem. Drop rather than maintain.
- skillc and orch build skills are complementary, not competing
  - Reason: skillc compiles project-local .skillc/ to CLAUDE.md; orch build skills compiles templated skills to ~/.claude/skills/. Different purposes, both needed.
- Tmux spawn uses opencode attach mode
  - Reason: Enables dual TUI+API access - sessions visible via orch status while still showing TUI for visual monitoring

  - Summary:
    Anthropic restricts Opus 4.5 access via fingerprinting that blocks API usage but allows Claude Code CLI with Max subscription. This constraint forced a **dual spawn architecture**: primary path (OpenCode API + Sonnet/Flash, headless, high concurrency) and escape hatch (Claude CLI + Opus, tmux, crash-resistant). The escape hatch exists because critical infrastructure work (fixing the spawn system itself) can't depend on what might fail. Model choice now encodes reliability requirements, not just quality preferences.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Never spawn OpenCode infrastructure work without --backend claude --tmux**
       - Violation: Agent kills itself mid-execution when server restarts
    
    2. **Infrastructure detection runs before model auto-selection**
       - Priority 2.5 (between explicit flags and model-based selection)
       - Ensures auto-apply happens even without explicit --backend
    
    3. **Opus only accessible via Claude CLI backend**
       - API requests to Opus fail with auth error
       - Fingerprinting checks more than headers (TLS, HTTP/2 frames, ordering)
    
    4. **Escape hatch provides true independence**
       - Claude CLI binary ≠ OpenCode server
       - Tmux session persists across service restarts
       - Different authentication path (Max subscription OAuth)
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Zombie Agents (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Agents tracked in registry but never actually ran
    
    **Root Cause:** Spawning with `--model opus` before understanding auth gate
    - orch created registry entry
    - OpenCode session created
    - Anthropic rejected API request (fingerprinting)
    - Agent hung in "running" state
    - Consumed concurrency slot without doing work
    
    **Examples:**
    - orch-go-mo0ja, orch-go-pzi2i, orch-go-aoei0, orch-go-gd1gd, orch-go-lwc3o
    
    **Fix:** Never use `--model opus` without `--backend claude`
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Header Injection Conflicts (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Gemini Flash spawns hung after attempting Opus bypass
    
    **Root Cause:** Injected Claude Code headers (`x-app: cli`, `anthropic-version`, etc.) into OpenCode's Anthropic provider
    - Bypassed Opus gate (didn't work)
    - Broke Gemini spawns (headers conflicted with Bun fetch/SDK)
    - System-wide impact from localized change
    
    **Lesson:** Fingerprinting is more sophisticated than headers alone
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Infrastructure Work Kills Itself
    
    **Symptom:** Agent fixing OpenCode server crashes mid-execution
    
    **Root Cause:** Agent spawned via OpenCode API, agent's fix restarts OpenCode server, agent's session killed
    
    **Solution:** Infrastructure work detection auto-applies `--backend claude --tmux`
    
    **Why auto-detection matters:**
    - Humans forget to add flags manually
    - Task description might not mention "opencode" explicitly
    - Keyword scan catches common patterns
    - Escape hatch becomes invisible safety net

  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/spawn-architecture.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**

    Changed files: cmd/orch/spawn_cmd.go, pkg/spawn/context.go, pkg/spawn/config.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Spawn evolved through 5 phases from basic CLI integration to daemon-driven automation with triage friction. The architecture creates a workspace with SPAWN_CONTEXT.md embedding skill content + task description + kb context, then launches an OpenCode session. The tier system (light/full) determines whether SYNTHESIS.md is required at completion. Triage friction (`--bypass-triage` flag) intentionally makes manual spawns harder to encourage daemon-driven workflow.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Workspace name = kebab-case task description** - Used for tmux window, directory name, session title
    2. **Beads ID required for phase reporting** - `--no-track` creates untracked IDs that can't report to beads
    3. **KB context uses --global flag** - Cross-repo constraints are essential
    4. **Skill content stripped for --no-track** - Beads instructions removed when not tracking
    5. **Session scoping is per-project** - `orch send` only works within same directory hash
    6. **Token estimation at 4 chars/token** - Warning at 100k, error at 150k
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Cross-Project Spawn Sets Wrong Session Directory
    
    **Symptom:** `orch spawn --workdir /other/project` creates session with orchestrator's directory
    
    **Root cause:** Session directory is set from spawn caller's CWD, not `--workdir` target
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - OpenCode infers directory from process CWD
    - `--workdir` changes agent's working directory, not spawn process CWD
    - Session gets orchestrator directory, beads issue in orchestrator project
    
    **Impact:**
    - Sessions unfindable via directory filtering
    - Cross-project work tracking is split
    
    **Fix needed:** Pass explicit directory to OpenCode session creation
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Token Limit Exceeded on Spawn
    
    **Symptom:** Spawn fails with "context too large" error
    
    **Root cause:** SPAWN_CONTEXT.md exceeds 150k token limit
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Skill content (~10-40k tokens)
    - KB context can be large (30-50k tokens)
    - Task description minimal
    - Estimation: 4 chars/token
    
    **Fix (Dec 22):** Warning at 100k tokens, hard error at 150k with guidance
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Daemon Spawns Blocked Issues
    
    **Symptom:** Daemon spawns issue that has blockers
    
    **Root cause:** Dependency checking missing in triage workflow
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - `bd ready` returns issues without blockers
    - Daemon spawns from `triage:ready` label (doesn't check dependencies)
    - Race condition: issue labeled before dependencies checked
    
    **Fix (Jan 3):** Dependency gating with `--force` override flag

- Daemon Autonomous Operation
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/daemon-autonomous-operation.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-12.
    Changed files: pkg/daemon/daemon.go, pkg/daemon/skill_inference.go, pkg/daemon/completion_processing.go, pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go, cmd/orch/daemon.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The daemon is an **autonomous agent spawner** that operates in a **poll-spawn-complete cycle**: polls beads for `triage:ready` issues, infers skill from issue type, spawns within capacity limits, monitors for `Phase: Complete`, verifies and closes. The daemon operates **independently of orchestrators** - orchestrators triage (label issues ready), daemon spawns (batch processing), orchestrators synthesize (review completed work). Skill inference uses **issue type** (not labels) to map task→investigation, bug→systematic-debugging, etc. Capacity management uses **WorkerPool** with reconciliation against OpenCode to free stale slots.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Capacity Starvation
    
    **What happens:** Pool shows MaxAgents active, but `orch status` shows fewer actual agents running.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn failures don't release slots. Agent spawned, counted against pool, but spawn fails (bad skill name, missing context, etc.) - slot never released.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Pool only knows about attempts, not outcomes. No feedback loop from spawn failure to pool.
    
    **Fix:** Reconciliation with OpenCode. Query actual sessions, release slots for non-existent agents.
    
    **Prevention:** Spawn tracking with retry limits (`pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`).
    
    ### 2. Duplicate Spawns
    
    **What happens:** Same issue spawned multiple times by daemon on consecutive polls.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn latency. Issue labeled `triage:ready` at poll N, daemon spawns, but spawn hasn't transitioned issue to `in_progress` by poll N+1. Daemon sees same issue still ready, spawns again.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Race condition between poll interval (60s) and spawn transition time (variable).
    
    **Fix:** Spawn deduplication via tracking. Track spawned beads IDs in memory, skip on subsequent polls until status confirms transition.
    
    **Source:** `pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`
    
    ### 3. Skill Inference Mismatch
    
    **What happens:** Daemon spawns wrong skill for issue type.
    
    **Root cause:** Issue type doesn't match actual work needed. User creates `task` for implementation work (should be `feature`), daemon infers `investigation`.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Type is set at creation, can't be changed by daemon. Daemon trusts type.
    
    **Fix:** Manual override. Orchestrator updates issue type before labeling `triage:ready`, or spawns manually with correct skill.
    
    **Prevention:** Better issue creation prompts, type validation, skill override via labels (future).

  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/escape-hatch-visibility-architecture.md
  - Summary:
    **Core insight:** The architectural choice of dual-window Ghostty setup isn't just "nice to have" - it's a **required component** of escape-hatch spawning architecture.
    
    ```
    Critical Infrastructure Work
      → Requires Escape Hatch (independence + visibility + capability)
        → Visibility Requires --tmux Flag
          → --tmux Requires Dual-Window Setup
            → Dual-Window Requires Auto-Switch Hook
    ```
    
    Remove any link in this chain and the visibility criterion fails.

- System Learning Loop
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/system-learning-loop.md
  - Summary:
    The System Learning Loop is the third layer of the Pressure Visibility System that automatically converts recurring context gaps into actionable improvements. It tracks gaps during spawns, identifies patterns using RecurrenceThreshold=3, and suggests specific actions (kn entries, beads issues, investigations). The system uses shell-aware command parsing to generate runnable commands with proper quoted string handling, and ensures minimum length requirements for downstream tools (kn requires 20+ chars). This creates a closed feedback loop: gaps → patterns → suggestions → improvements → fewer gaps.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **RecurrenceThreshold = 3** - Pattern detection balances noise (1) vs signal (3+)
    2. **All matching events must be marked resolved** - Not just the most recent one
    3. **FindRecurringGaps excludes resolved events** - Prevents resolved gaps from reappearing
    4. **Shell-aware command parsing required** - Quoted strings with spaces must be preserved
    5. **Minimum 20-character reasons** - kn decide/constrain requirement enforced at generation time
    6. **30-day retention window** - Gap events older than 30 days are pruned
    7. **Gap recording happens after gating** - Captures all gaps whether spawn proceeds or not
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Resolved Gaps Keep Appearing
    
    **Symptom:** `orch learn` shows same gap after running `orch learn act` to resolve it
    
    **Root cause:** Two bugs combined:
    1. `RecordResolution` only marked the most recent event (used `break` after first match)
    2. `FindRecurringGaps` counted all events without filtering by Resolution field
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Gap occurs 5 times → user resolves → only 1 event marked
    - Next `FindRecurringGaps` call counts 4 unresolved events → still above threshold (3)
    - Same pattern keeps appearing despite resolution
    
    **Impact:**
    - User frustration ("I already fixed this!")
    - Loss of trust in learning system
    - Duplicate work
    
    **Fix:**
    - `RecordResolution` now marks ALL matching events (removed `break`)
    - `FindRecurringGaps` filters out resolved events before counting

    ### Failure Mode 2: Generated Commands Fail Due to Broken Quoting
    
    **Symptom:** `orch learn act N` generates command that fails when executed
    
    **Root cause:** Using `strings.Fields()` to parse commands - splits on whitespace without respecting quotes
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Command: `kn decide "auth" --reason "Used by: investigation. Occurred 5 times"`
    - `strings.Fields` splits into: `["kn", "decide", "\"auth\"", "--reason", "\"Used", "by:", "investigation.", ...]`
    - Shell receives mangled arguments, command fails
    
    **Impact:**
    - Learning loop broken - suggestions can't be executed
    - User must manually reconstruct commands
    - Reduces value of automated suggestions
    
    **Fix:**
    - Added `ParseShellCommand()` with shell-aware quote handling
    - Respects double and single quotes as argument delimiters
    - Added `ValidateCommand()` to catch malformed commands before execution
    
    **Source:** `.kb/investigations/2025-12-26-inv-orch-learn-act-commands-should.md`
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Short Reasons Fail kn Validation
    
    **Symptom:** `orch learn act` generates kn command that fails with "reason too short" error
    
    **Root cause:** `generateReasonFromGaps` produced "Occurred N times" (16 chars) when gap events lacked skill/task metadata
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Gap events with sparse metadata → only occurrence count available
    - "Occurred 3 times" = 16 characters
    - kn requires 20+ characters for `--reason` flag
    - Command fails validation at execution time
    
    **Impact:**
    - Generated commands unusable
    - User must manually edit reason strings
    - Learning loop broken for sparse gaps
    
    **Fix:**

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- debugging Insufficient Balance error when orch usage showed 99% remaining
- orch tail on tmux agent
- orch clean to remove ghost sessions automatically
- BEADS_NO_DAEMON=1 in .zshrc only

### Open Questions
- When should orchestrator use 'orch send' for follow-up vs spawn fresh investigation? What are session expiration limits, context degradation patterns, and phase reporting implications?

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-82eg "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment orch-go-82eg "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-82eg "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-rethink-orch-spawn-15feb-d93f/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.



## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-82eg**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-82eg "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-82eg "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-82eg "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-82eg "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-82eg "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-82eg`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

## Summary

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

---

# Worker Base Patterns

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

**What this provides:**
- Authority delegation (what you can decide vs escalate)
- Hard limits (constitutional constraints that override all authority)
- Constitutional objection protocol (how to raise ethical concerns)
- Beads progress tracking (how to report via bd comment)
- Phase reporting (how to signal transitions)
- Exit/completion protocol (how to properly end a session)

---



## Authority Delegation

**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

---



## Hard Limits (Constitutional)

**These limits override ALL authority - orchestrator, user, or otherwise.**

Workers CANNOT do these regardless of instruction:

| Hard Limit | Constitutional Basis |
|------------|---------------------|
| Generate malware, exploits, or attack tools | Claude doesn't create weapons |
| Implement deceptive UI patterns (dark patterns) | Claude doesn't manipulate users |
| Build surveillance without consent disclosure | User autonomy and transparency |
| Intentionally bypass authentication/authorization | System integrity |
| Create content designed to deceive | Honesty as near-constraint |
| Automate harassment or mass targeting | Avoiding harm |
| Implement discriminatory logic | Ethical AI principles |

**When instructed to violate a hard limit:**

1. **Document** - `bd comment <id> "HARD LIMIT: [limit] - Cannot proceed with [specific instruction]"`
2. **Do NOT proceed** - No partial implementation, no "just this once"
3. **Continue other work** - If task has separable components, complete those
4. **Wait for human** - This bypasses orchestrator; only human can review

**Why these are non-negotiable:** Claude's constitution establishes these as near-inviolable constraints. Orchestrators are Claude instances too - they cannot authorize violations. Only human judgment can evaluate edge cases.

**Common false positives (these are usually OK):**
- Security testing tools for authorized pentesting
- Analytics with proper consent disclosure
- Authentication code (building it, not bypassing it)
- Competitive analysis (observation, not deception)

---



## Constitutional Objection Protocol

**Trigger:** You believe an instruction conflicts with constitutional values (safety, ethics, honesty, user wellbeing) but it's not a clear Hard Limit violation.

**This is DIFFERENT from operational escalation:**

| Type | Examples | Route |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Operational** | "I'm blocked", "Requirements unclear", "Need decision" | → Orchestrator |
| **Constitutional** | "This could harm users", "This feels deceptive", "Ethical concern" | → Human (bypasses orchestrator) |

**Protocol when you have a constitutional concern:**

1. **Identify the value** - Which constitutional principle is at risk? (safety, honesty, user autonomy, avoiding harm)

2. **Document it** - `bd comment <id> "CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: [value] - [specific concern]"`

3. **Do NOT proceed** with the concerning component

4. **Continue** with unrelated components if the task is separable

5. **Wait for HUMAN review** - Do not accept orchestrator override on constitutional matters

**Why this bypasses orchestrator:**

Claude's constitution says Claude can refuse unethical instructions regardless of the principal hierarchy. Orchestrators are Claude instances - they cannot authorize constitutional violations any more than you can. Human judgment is required for genuine ethical edge cases.

**Examples:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Add tracking pixel without disclosure" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: user autonomy - undisclosed tracking |
| "Make the unsubscribe button hard to find" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: honesty - dark pattern design |
| "Scrape competitor's user data" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: ethics - unauthorized data collection |
| "Build feature that targets vulnerable users" | CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN: avoiding harm - exploitation risk |

**When it's NOT a constitutional concern:**
- Technical disagreements about implementation
- Preference for different architecture
- Belief that requirements are suboptimal
- Wanting more context before proceeding

These are operational - escalate to orchestrator normally.

---



## Progress Tracking

**Use `bd comment` for phase transitions and progress updates.**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: BLOCKED - Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: QUESTION - Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to report:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Additional context:**
Use `bd comment` for additional context, findings, or updates:
```bash
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Found performance bottleneck in database query"
bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "investigation_path: .kb/investigations/2026-02-11-perf-issue.md"
```

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
When reporting Phase: Complete, include test results in the summary:
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: go test ./... - 47 passed, 0 failed (2.3s)"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: npm test - 23 specs, 0 failures"`
- Example: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - Tests: make test - PASS (coverage: 78%)"`

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in phase comments. Vague claims like "all tests pass" trigger manual verification.

**Never run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
- Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
- Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

---



## Phase Reporting

**First 3 Actions (Critical):**
Within your first 3 tool calls, you MUST:
1. Report via `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors phase reporting.

**Status Updates:**
Update Status: field in your workspace/investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed)

**Signal orchestrator when blocked:**
- Add `**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]` to workspace
- Add `**Status:** QUESTION - [question]` when needing input

---



## Discovered Work (Mandatory)

**Before marking your session complete, review for discovered work.**

During any session, you may encounter:
- **Bugs** - Broken behavior not related to your current task
- **Tech debt** - Code that should be refactored but is out of scope
- **Enhancements** - Ideas for improvements noticed while working
- **Questions** - Strategic unknowns needing orchestrator input

### Checklist

Before completing your session:

- [ ] Reviewed for discovered work (bugs, tech debt, enhancements, questions)
- [ ] Created issues via `bd create` OR noted "No discovered work" in completion comment

### Creating Issues

```bash
# For bugs found
bd create "description of bug" --type bug -l triage:review

# For tech debt or refactoring needs
bd create "description" --type task -l triage:review

# For feature ideas or enhancements
bd create "description" --type feature -l triage:review

# For strategic questions needing decision
bd create "description" --type question -l triage:review
```

### Reporting

In your `Phase: Complete` comment, include either:
- List of issues created: `Created: orch-go-XXXXX, orch-go-YYYYY`
- Or: `No discovered work`

**Why this matters:** Discovered work that isn't tracked gets lost. The next session has no visibility into bugs or opportunities you found. Creating issues ensures nothing falls through the cracks.

### Cross-Repo Issue Handoff

**When you discover an issue that belongs to a different repo**, you cannot create it directly — `bd create` only works in the current project directory, and shell sandboxing prevents `cd` to other repos.

**Instead, output a structured `CROSS_REPO_ISSUE` block** in your beads completion comment or SYNTHESIS.md. The orchestrator will pick this up during completion review and create the issue in the target repo.

**Format:**
```
CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/<target-repo>
  title: "<concise issue title>"
  type: bug|task|feature|question
  priority: 0-4
  description: "<1-3 sentences with context, evidence, and why it matters>"
```

**Rules:**
- Use absolute or `~`-relative paths for `repo`
- Include enough context in `description` for the issue to stand alone (the orchestrator in the other repo won't have your session context)
- One block per issue — multiple issues get multiple blocks
- Report blocks in your `Phase: Complete` comment: `Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block for price-watch`

**Example:**
```bash
bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Implemented token refresh. Cross-repo: 1 CROSS_REPO_ISSUE block below.

CROSS_REPO_ISSUE:
  repo: ~/Documents/personal/price-watch
  title: Fix ScsOauthClient concurrent token refresh
  type: bug
  priority: 2
  description: During orch-go token handling work, discovered price-watch ScsOauthClient has a race condition when multiple goroutines call RefreshToken simultaneously. No mutex protects the shared token state."
```

---



## Session Complete Protocol

**When your work is done (all deliverables ready), complete in this EXACT order:**

{{if eq .Tier "light"}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
4. Commit any remaining changes (including `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
5. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

**Light Tier:** SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.
{{else}}
1. Author/update `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` in the workspace root.
   - Fill the pre-populated skeleton with the exact commands you ran, expectations you verified, and any manual steps still required.
2. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - "[1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
3. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created with these required sections:
   - **`Plain-Language Summary`** (REQUIRED): 2-4 sentences in plain language describing what you built/found/decided and why it matters. This is the scaffolding the orchestrator uses during completion review — write it for a human who hasn't read your code. No jargon without explanation. No "implemented X" without saying what X does.
   - **`Verification Contract`**: Link to `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml` and key outcomes
4. **Verify all .kb/ files are committed:**
   - Run: `git status --porcelain` and check for any .kb/ files (investigations, probes, decisions, etc.)
   - If uncommitted .kb/ files exist: `git add .kb/ && git commit -m "knowledge artifacts from session"`
   - This ensures probe files in .kb/models/{name}/probes/ are not left behind
5. Commit all remaining changes (including SYNTHESIS.md and `VERIFICATION_SPEC.yaml`)
6. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session
{{end}}

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility even if the agent dies before committing.

**Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.**
The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.

## Summary

**Model:** Planning as Decision Navigation (`~/.kb/models/planning-as-decision-navigation.md`)

---

# Decision Navigation Protocol

**Model:** Planning as Decision Navigation (`~/.kb/models/planning-as-decision-navigation.md`)

Planning is not task enumeration. Planning is navigating decision forks with informed recommendations.

---

## Substrate Consultation (Before Any Recommendation)

Before recommending any approach, consult the substrate stack:

### 1. Principles (`~/.kb/principles.md`)

- Which principles constrain this decision?
- Does any option violate a principle?
- Cite the principle when relevant to your recommendation.

### 2. Models (`kb context "{domain}"`)

Run `kb context` for the relevant domain. Check:
- What models exist for this problem space?
- What constraints do they specify?
- What failure modes do they document?

### 3. Decisions (`.kb/decisions/`)

- Has this decision been made before?
- What reasoning applied then?
- What conditions would change that reasoning?

### 4. Current Context

- Given all the above, which option fits now?
- What's unique about this situation?

**When presenting recommendations, show your substrate trace:**

```markdown
**SUBSTRATE:**
- Principle: [X] says...
- Model: [Y] constrains...
- Decision: [Z] established...

**RECOMMENDATION:** [Option] because [reasoning from substrate]
```

---

## Fork Navigation (Core Protocol)

Design work surfaces decision forks - points where the design could go different ways.

### Identifying Forks

Instead of listing "approaches," ask: **What are the decision points?**

For each fork:
1. **State the decision explicitly** - Frame as a question
2. **List the options** - What are the viable paths?
3. **Consult substrate** - What do principles/models/decisions say?
4. **Recommend** - Which option, based on substrate
5. **Note unknowns** - What can't be answered without probing?

### Fork Documentation Format

```markdown
### Fork: [Decision Question]

**Options:**
- A: [Description]
- B: [Description]
- C: [Description]

**Substrate says:**
- Principle X: [constraint]
- Model Y: [relevant behavior]
- Decision Z: [precedent]

**Recommendation:** Option [X] because [substrate-based reasoning]

**Unknown:** [Any uncertainty that needs probing]
```

---

## Spike Protocol (When Fork is Unknown)

Sometimes you can't navigate a fork - insufficient model exists. A **spike** is a small, time-boxed experiment to resolve uncertainty at a decision fork. (Distinct from model-scoped **probes**, which are confirmatory tests of model claims in `.kb/models/{name}/probes/`.)

### Recognizing Unknown Forks

Signs you need to spike:
- "It depends on..." (but you don't know what it depends on)
- No relevant model exists for this domain
- Past decisions don't apply to this context
- Substrate consultation returns nothing useful

### The Spike Response

When a fork is unknown, don't guess. Instead:

1. **Acknowledge:** "I don't have sufficient model for this fork."

2. **Propose spike:** Small experiment to surface constraints
   - What's the smallest thing we could try to learn?
   - What would 5 minutes of prototyping reveal?
   - What question would an investigation answer?

3. **Bound the spike:** Define success criteria
   - What specifically would the spike reveal?
   - How will we know the fork is now navigable?

4. **Execute or delegate:** Either spike now or spawn investigation

### Spike Patterns

| Situation | Spike Type | Example |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Technical uncertainty | Prototype | "Let me try X in 5 lines to see if it works" |
| Design uncertainty | Sketch | "Let me draw the data flow to see if it makes sense" |
| Domain uncertainty | Investigation | "Spawn investigation to understand how X works" |
| User preference | Ask | "Which of these tradeoffs matters more to you?" |

---

## Readiness Test (Before Execution)

A design is "ready" not when tasks are listed, but when you can navigate the decisions.

### The Readiness Question

> For each decision fork ahead, can I explain which option is better and why, based on principles, models, and past decisions?

- **If yes for all forks:** Ready to implement
- **If no for any fork:** Still in spiking/model-building phase

### Pre-Execution Checklist

Before declaring design complete:

- [ ] **Forks identified:** All decision points are explicit
- [ ] **Forks navigated:** Each has a recommendation with substrate reasoning
- [ ] **Unknowns spiked:** No forks remain with "it depends" uncertainty
- [ ] **Substrate cited:** Recommendations trace to principles/models/decisions

### What This Rejects

- **Task-list theater:** "Here's the plan" that's really a guess
- **Premature execution:** Starting implementation with unknown forks
- **Context-free recommendations:** Suggestions without substrate trace

---

## Failure Updates the Model

When reality differs from the model, that's not failure - that's learning.

### The Update Loop

```
Navigate fork based on model
    ↓
Execute
    ↓
Reality reveals unexpected constraint
    ↓
Update model (or create kb quick entry)
    ↓
Future decisions are better informed
```

### Capturing Failures

When a decision turns out wrong:

```bash
# Record what we learned
kb quick tried "Chose X at fork Y" --failed "Constraint Z not in model"

# Or update the model if systemic
# Add to Evolution section of relevant .kb/models/*.md
```

The goal: Next Claude navigating similar forks has the constraint in substrate.

---

## Integration with Skill Workflow

This protocol integrates with skill phases:

| Skill Phase | Decision Navigation Activity |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Problem Framing** | Identify what forks might exist |
| **Exploration** | Surface forks, consult substrate for each |
| **Synthesis** | Navigate forks, make recommendations |
| **Externalization** | Document fork decisions and substrate reasoning |

The skill's normal phase structure remains - decision navigation is how you work within each phase.

## Summary

**Purpose:** Transform vague ideas into actionable, well-scoped work through structured context gathering and collaborative discussion.

# Design Session Skill

**Purpose:** Transform vague ideas into actionable, well-scoped work through structured context gathering and collaborative discussion.

---

## When to Use

| Use design-session | Use architect | Use investigation |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "I want to add X" (vague scope) | "Should we do X?" (strategic choice) | "How does X work?" (understand existing) |
| Feature ideation | Trade-off analysis | Root cause analysis |
| Scope definition | System shaping | Codebase exploration |

**The key distinction:** Design-session is for *scoping work*, architect is for *strategic decisions*, investigation is for *understanding*.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)
    ↓
Phase 2: Design Synthesis (Semi-Autonomous)
    ↓
Phase 3: Output Creation (Autonomous)
    ↓
One of: Epic | Investigation | Decision
    + Optional: Verification Specification (for multi-agent handoff)
```

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)

**Goal:** Understand existing context before discussing scope.

### 1.0 Review Foundational Principles

**Before scoping work, review:** `~/.kb/principles.md`

Key principles for design sessions:
- **Premise before solution** - Before scoping "how to do X", validate "should we do X?" Don't assume the request direction is correct
- **Evolve by distinction** - When scope is unclear, ask "what are we conflating?"
- **Evidence hierarchy** - Code is truth; artifacts are hypotheses to verify
- **Session amnesia** - Will this scoping help the next Claude resume?
- **Escalation is information flow** - When scope discussion reveals strategic uncertainty, escalate - you're routing information to someone who can see patterns you can't

Consider which principles apply when making scoping decisions.

### 1.1 Gather Knowledge Context

```bash
# Find relevant knowledge (constraints, decisions, investigations)
kb context "<topic keywords>"

# Example
kb context "rate limiting"
kb context "user authentication"
```

### 1.2 Gather Issue Context

```bash
# Find related beads issues
bd list --labels "<area>" 2>/dev/null | head -20
bd ready | grep -i "<keyword>" | head -10

# Find blocked work that might be related
bd blocked | grep -i "<keyword>" | head -10
```

### 1.3 Gather Codebase Context (If Applicable)

```bash
# Find relevant code areas
rg "<keyword>" --type-list  # See available types
rg "<pattern>" --type py -l | head -10

# Read key files
# Use Read tool for files identified above
```

### 1.4 Document Findings

Create a structured summary of what you found:

```markdown
## Context Gathered

### Existing Knowledge
- [kb quick entries found]
- [relevant investigations]
- [applicable decisions]

### Related Issues
- [existing issues on topic]
- [blocked items that relate]

### Codebase State
- [relevant files/modules]
- [existing implementations]
```

**Report:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Context Gathering - Found [N] related items"`

---

## Phase 2: Design Synthesis (Semi-Autonomous)

**Goal:** Present findings, navigate scoping forks through discussion, determine output type.

### 2.1 Present Context Summary with Substrate

Present findings with what the substrate (gathered in Phase 1) tells us:

```markdown
Here's what I found relevant to [topic]:

**Substrate (from Phase 1):**
- Principles: [relevant constraints from ~/.kb/principles.md]
- Models: [relevant models from kb context]
- Decisions: [prior decisions that apply]

**Related Work:**
- [existing issues]
- [blocked items]

**Current State:**
- [what exists in codebase]

**Scoping Forks Identified:**
1. [Fork: Should scope include X or not?]
2. [Fork: Which priority - A or B?]
```

### 2.2 Navigate Scoping Forks

Scoping is decision navigation. Each scope question is a fork.

**For each scoping fork, consult substrate:**

```markdown
### Fork: [Scoping Question]

**Options:**
- A: [Include X]
- B: [Exclude X]

**Substrate says:**
- Principle: [relevant constraint]
- Model: [relevant behavior]
- Decision: [precedent]

**Recommendation:** [Option] because [substrate reasoning]
```

**Scoping fork patterns:**

| Fork Type | Question Pattern | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Boundary** | "Include X or separate?" | "Should this include notifications or is that a separate epic?" |
| **Priority** | "Which first?" | "Which matters more - speed or completeness?" |
| **Constraint** | "Trade-off choice?" | "Are you optimizing for user experience or simplicity?" |
| **Dependency** | "Order of work?" | "Does this need the API first, or can frontend proceed in parallel?" |

**If a fork is unknown:** Acknowledge it explicitly. Propose a spike or mark it as a follow-up investigation.

**Use natural conversation for discussion.** Reserve the question tool for:
- Forcing explicit choice between options
- When multiple rounds haven't converged

**question tool interface:**
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Complete question text",
    "header": "Short label (max 12 chars)",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Option (1-5 words)", "description": "Explanation"}
    ]
  }]
}
```
- Make recommended option first with "(Recommended)" in label
- Users can always select "Other" for custom input

### 2.3 Determine Output Type

Based on discussion, assess clarity level:

| Clarity Level | Output Type | Indicators |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **High** | Epic with children | Clear scope, decomposable into tasks, no major unknowns |
| **Medium** | Investigation | Some unknowns remain, need exploration first |
| **Low** | Decision | Architectural choice blocks progress |

**Decision tree:**

```
Can we list the specific tasks needed?
├── YES → Do we understand all the tasks well enough to implement?
│   ├── YES → Epic with children
│   └── NO → Investigation (to clarify unknowns)
└── NO → Is this blocked by a strategic choice?
    ├── YES → Decision artifact
    └── NO → Investigation (to discover tasks)
```

**Report:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design Synthesis - Determined output: [type]"`

---

## Phase 3: Output Creation (Autonomous)

Based on the determined output type, follow the appropriate path.

---

### Path A: Epic with Children

**When:** Scope is clear, work decomposes into discrete tasks.

#### A.1 Create the Epic

```bash
bd create "Epic: [high-level goal]" \
  --type epic \
  --description "## Goal

[What this epic achieves]

## Scope

- [In scope item 1]
- [In scope item 2]

## Out of Scope

- [Explicitly excluded]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]"
```

#### A.2 Create Child Issues

For each discrete task:

```bash
bd create "[Task title]" \
  --type task \
  --parent <epic-id> \
  --description "## Context

Part of [epic-id]: [epic title]

## Task

[What needs to be done]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]"
```

#### A.3 Set Up Dependencies (If Needed)

```bash
# If task B depends on task A
bd dep add <task-b-id> --blocks <task-a-id>

# Common patterns:
# - Design → Implementation
# - Backend → Frontend
# - Core → Extensions
```

#### A.4 Apply Labels

```bash
# For all children
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready  # Ready for work
bd label <issue-id> area:auth     # Area label
```

**Reference: Beads Epic Patterns**

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sequential** | Tasks must be done in order | Design → Implement → Test |
| **Parallel** | Tasks can be done independently | Multiple unrelated features |
| **Diamond** | Multiple paths converge | Backend + Frontend → Integration |

---

### Path B: Investigation

**When:** Unknowns remain that need exploration before planning.

#### B.1 Create Investigation

```bash
kb create investigation design/<slug>
```

#### B.2 Document What's Known and Unknown

Fill the investigation template:

```markdown
# Design Investigation: [Topic]

**Date:** [today]
**Status:** Active

## Question

What do we need to understand before we can plan [topic]?

## What We Know

- [From context gathering]
- [From discussion]

## What We Need to Learn

1. [Unknown 1]
2. [Unknown 2]

## Proposed Exploration

- [ ] [Investigation step 1]
- [ ] [Investigation step 2]

## Next Steps

After this investigation, expect to produce:
- [ ] Epic with children (if unknowns resolved)
- [ ] Decision artifact (if choice needed)
```

#### B.3 Create Follow-Up Issue

```bash
bd create "Investigate: [topic] design unknowns" \
  --type task \
  --description "Investigation artifact: .kb/investigations/[date]-design-[slug].md

Complete the investigation, then create follow-up work based on findings."
```

---

### Path C: Decision

**When:** Architectural choice blocks progress.

#### C.1 Create Decision Artifact

```bash
kb create decision <slug>
```

#### C.2 Document the Choice Needed

Fill the decision template:

```markdown
# [Decision Title]

**Date:** [today]
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

[Why this decision is needed now]

## Question

[The specific architectural question]

## Options

### Option A: [Name]

**Description:** [How it works]
**Pros:** [Benefits]
**Cons:** [Drawbacks]

### Option B: [Name]

**Description:** [How it works]
**Pros:** [Benefits]
**Cons:** [Drawbacks]

## Recommendation

[If you have one, state it with reasoning]

## Decision

[Leave blank - Dylan decides]

## Consequences

[What changes based on the decision]
```

#### C.3 Create Decision Review Issue

```bash
bd create "Decision needed: [topic]" \
  --type task \
  --labels "triage:review" \
  --description "Decision artifact: .kb/decisions/[date]-[slug].md

Review and make the architectural choice before proceeding with implementation."
```

---

## Companion Artifact: Verification Specification (Optional)

**Purpose:** When design outputs will be implemented by other agents, produce a verification specification that defines *how to know the implementation is correct*.

**When to include:**
- Epic with children → **Recommended** (helps implementation agents)
- Investigation → Optional (if the investigation produces testable conclusions)
- Decision → Optional (if the decision has verifiable consequences)

**The verification spec is NOT required for every design session.** Use judgment:
- Simple, obvious scope → Skip verification spec
- Complex feature, multi-agent handoff → Include verification spec

---

### Verification Spec Template (Full)

Create at `.kb/specifications/VERIFICATION-SPEC-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Verification Specification: [Feature Name]

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Design Document:** [path to epic/investigation/decision]

---

## Observable Behaviors

> What can be seen when this feature is working correctly?

### Primary Behavior
[One sentence describing the main observable behavior]

### Secondary Behaviors (if applicable)
- [Additional observable behaviors]

### UI Behaviors (if applicable)
- [Visual changes, user interactions]

### Data Behaviors (if applicable)
- [Database state changes, API responses]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

> Pass/fail conditions for each behavior.

### [Criterion ID: AC-001]
**Behavior:** [Which observable behavior this verifies]
**Condition:** [Testable condition - MUST/SHOULD/MAY verb + measurable outcome]
**Threshold:** [Numeric threshold if applicable, or "Boolean pass/fail"]

### [Criterion ID: AC-002]
[Repeat pattern]

---

## Failure Modes

> What breaks this feature and how to diagnose?

### Failure Mode 1: [Name]
**Symptom:** [What agent/user observes when this fails]
**Root Cause:** [Why this happens]
**Diagnostic:** [How to confirm this is the cause]
**Fix:** [How to resolve]

### Failure Mode 2: [Name]
[Repeat pattern]

---

## Evidence Requirements

> How to prove verification happened?

| Criterion | Evidence Type | Artifact |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| AC-001 | [test output / screenshot / log / metric] | [artifact name or path] |
| AC-002 | [type] | [artifact] |
```

---

### Minimum Viable Verification Spec (Simplified)

For simple features, use this reduced format:

```markdown
# Verification Specification: [Feature Name]

## Observable Behavior
[What can be seen when working correctly - one sentence]

## Acceptance Criterion
[Testable pass/fail condition - one criterion]

## Failure Mode
**Symptom:** [What you see when broken]
**Fix:** [How to resolve]

## Evidence
[What artifact proves it works: test output / screenshot / etc.]
```

---

### Integration with Output Paths

#### For Epics (Path A)
After creating children, optionally create verification spec:
```bash
mkdir -p .kb/specifications
# Create VERIFICATION-SPEC-{slug}.md with template above
```

Reference in epic description:
```markdown
## Verification Specification
See: .kb/specifications/VERIFICATION-SPEC-{slug}.md
```

#### For Investigations (Path B)
If investigation produces testable conclusions, create verification spec for:
- Each finding that will become a requirement
- The overall "how will we know the investigation's recommendations worked?"

#### For Decisions (Path C)
If decision has verifiable consequences, include verification spec for:
- How to measure whether the chosen option succeeded
- What would indicate the decision was wrong (feedback loop)

---

## Beads Mastery Reference

### Creating Epics with Children

```bash
# Step 1: Create epic
bd create "Epic: User authentication" --type epic --description "..."
# Returns: orch-abc123

# Step 2: Create children with parent reference
bd create "Design auth flow" --type task --parent orch-abc123
bd create "Implement login" --type task --parent orch-abc123
bd create "Add tests" --type task --parent orch-abc123
```

### Setting Up Dependencies

```bash
# Task B is blocked by Task A (A must finish first)
bd dep add <task-b> --blocks <task-a>

# Check dependency tree
bd dep tree <epic-id>

# Find issues blocked by something
bd blocked
```

### Labels for Triage

| Label | Meaning | When to Apply |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `triage:ready` | Ready for work | Clear scope, no blockers |
| `triage:review` | Needs human review | Uncertainty, needs input |
| `area:*` | Component area | auth, ui, api, etc. |
| `skill:*` | Recommended skill | feature-impl, investigation, etc. |

```bash
# Apply labels
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready
bd label <issue-id> area:auth skill:feature-impl
```

### Epic Status Checking

```bash
# See epic completion status
bd epic status <epic-id>

# Close eligible epics (all children done)
bd epic close-eligible
```

---

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify:

### Phase Completion

| Phase | Check | If Failed |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Context Gathering** | Ran kb context and bd queries? Substrate documented? | Run now |
| **Design Synthesis** | Scoping forks identified and navigated? Substrate cited? | Navigate forks |
| **Output Creation** | Produced appropriate artifact? | Complete output |
| **Verification Spec** | For multi-agent handoff or complex scope: Created verification spec? | Consider adding (optional) |

### Fork Navigation Quality

- [ ] **Scoping forks identified** - All scope decisions are explicit
- [ ] **Substrate consulted** - Each fork references principles/models/decisions
- [ ] **Forks navigated** - Each has a recommendation (not "it depends")
- [ ] **Unknowns acknowledged** - Unknown forks marked for follow-up investigation

### Output Quality

#### For Epics:
- [ ] Epic has clear goal and scope
- [ ] Children are discrete, implementable tasks
- [ ] Dependencies set where needed
- [ ] Labels applied (triage:ready or triage:review)
- [ ] Each child has acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Verification spec considered** - If multi-agent handoff, created verification spec (optional but recommended)

#### For Investigations:
- [ ] Question clearly stated
- [ ] Known/unknown clearly separated
- [ ] Next steps defined
- [ ] Follow-up issue created

#### For Decisions:
- [ ] Context explains why now
- [ ] Options clearly presented
- [ ] Pros/cons for each option
- [ ] Review issue created

## Leave it Better (Mandatory)

**Before marking complete, externalize at least one piece of knowledge:**

| What You Learned | Command | Example |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| Made a choice with reasoning | `kb quick decide` | `kb quick decide "Scope auth to session-based only" --reason "OAuth deferred to phase 2"` |
| Tried something that failed | `kb quick tried` | `kb quick tried "Single mega-epic" --failed "Too large, decomposed into 3 smaller epics"` |
| Discovered a constraint | `kb quick constrain` | `kb quick constrain "Must maintain backward compat" --reason "Existing API consumers"` |
| Found an open question | `kb quick question` | `kb quick question "Should notifications be real-time or polling?"` |

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Reflected on session: What did I learn that the next agent should know?
- [ ] Externalized at least one item via `kb quick` command

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment: "Leave it Better: Scope decisions captured in artifacts, no additional knowledge to externalize."

---

## Completion Criteria

Before marking complete:

- [ ] Phase 1: Context gathered (or skip-context used), substrate documented
- [ ] Phase 2: Scoping forks identified and navigated with substrate trace
- [ ] **Readiness test:** For each scoping fork, can explain decision and cite substrate
- [ ] Phase 3: Appropriate artifact produced
- [ ] **Verification spec** (if applicable) - Created for multi-agent handoff scenarios
- [ ] **Leave it Better completed** - At least one `kb quick` command run OR noted as not applicable
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Report via beads: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Created [output type]: [summary]"`
- [ ] Call `/exit` to close agent session

## Related Skills

- **architect** - Use for strategic decisions with trade-off analysis
- **investigation** - Use when "how does X work?" (understand, not scope)
- **issue-creation** - Use for single issues from symptoms
- **feature-impl** - Use after design-session produces actionable epic/tasks

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Vague Feature Request

```
User: "We need better error handling"

Phase 1: Find existing error handling code, related issues
Phase 2: "Better" could mean many things - discuss scope
Phase 3: Likely → Epic with children (log errors, user messages, retry logic)
```

### Pattern: Technical Debt

```
User: "The auth system is a mess"

Phase 1: Audit auth code, find pain points
Phase 2: Prioritize which issues to address first
Phase 3: Could be → Investigation (if root cause unclear)
              → Epic (if clear what to fix)
```

### Pattern: New Feature Idea

```
User: "Can we add real-time notifications?"

Phase 1: Check existing notification code, related decisions
Phase 2: Scope: push vs pull, what triggers, where shown
Phase 3: Likely → Decision (architecture choice)
              → then Epic (implementation plan)
```
