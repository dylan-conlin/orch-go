📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.




## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "say hello exit"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- orch status can show phantom agents (tmux windows where OpenCode exited)
  - Reason: No reconciliation between tmux liveness and OpenCode session state

### Prior Decisions
- Add Leave it Better after self-review, before completion criteria
  - Reason: Natural position in workflow - self-review validates quality, Leave it Better captures knowledge, completion gates exit

### Models (synthesized understanding)

  - Summary:
    Orchestrator sessions operate in a **three-tier hierarchy** (meta-orchestrator → orchestrator → worker) where each level is completed by the level above. Orchestrators produce **SESSION_HANDOFF.md** (not SYNTHESIS.md) and **wait** for completion (not /exit). They track via **session registry** (not beads) because orchestrators manage conversations, not work items. Frame collapse occurs when orchestrators drop levels and do work below their station - detected externally, not self-diagnosed. Checkpoint discipline uses duration thresholds (2h/3h/4h) as a proxy for context exhaustion.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Frame Collapse (Orchestrator → Worker)
    
    **What happens:** Orchestrator drops into worker-level implementation (editing code, debugging, investigating).
    
    **Root cause:** Vague goals → exploration mode → investigation → debugging. **Framing cues override skill instructions.**
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Orchestrators can't self-diagnose frame collapse. The frame defines what's visible, so from inside the collapsed frame, the behavior feels appropriate.
    
    **Detection signals:**
    - Edit tool usage on code files (not orchestration artifacts)
    - Time spent >15 minutes on direct fixes
    - SESSION_HANDOFF.md shows "Manual fixes" sections
    - Post-mortem reveals work that should have been spawned
    
    **NOT the fix:** Adding more ABSOLUTE DELEGATION RULE warnings. The agent already knows. The problem is framing, not awareness.
    
    **Prevention:**
    1. Provide specific goals with action verbs, concrete deliverables, success criteria
    2. Use WHICH vs HOW test: meta decides WHICH focus, orchestrator decides HOW to execute
    3. Frame collapse check in SESSION_HANDOFF.md template
    4. Potential: OpenCode plugin tracking Edit usage on code vs artifacts
    
    **Trigger pattern:** Failure-to-implementation. After agents fail, orchestrator tries to "just fix it" instead of trying different spawn strategy.
    
    ### 2. Self-Termination Attempts
    
    **What happens:** Spawned orchestrator tries to run `orch session end` or `/exit` instead of waiting for completion.
    
    **Root cause:** ORCHESTRATOR_CONTEXT.md template contradicted the hierarchical completion model (told orchestrator to self-terminate).
    
    **Why it's wrong:** Breaks the "completed by level above" invariant. Orchestrator can't verify its own work from meta perspective.
    
    **Fix:** Template updated Jan 2026 to instruct "write SESSION_HANDOFF.md and WAIT".
    
    ### 3. Session Registry Drift
    
    **What happens:** `~/.orch/sessions.json` shows status "active" for completed sessions.
    
    **Root cause:** `orch complete` didn't update session registry status (only closed beads issues or removed registry entries).
    
    **Why it matters:** Stale active sessions accumulate, `orch status` shows ghost sessions, registry becomes unreliable.
    
    **Fix:** `orch complete` now updates status to "completed", `orch abandon` updates to "abandoned" - sessions preserved for history, not removed.

  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-14.
    Changed files: pkg/daemon/daemon.go.
    Deleted files: opencode/src/session/index.ts, opencode/src/config/config.ts, opencode/src/project/instance.ts, opencode/src/session/session.sql.ts, pkg/cleanup/sessions.go, ~/bin/disk-cleanup.sh.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Active OpenCode sessions can become unfindable through **7 independent vectors** spanning 3 systems (disk-cleanup.sh, orch-go cleanup, OpenCode itself). The fundamental problem is that no "session is active, do not touch" lock exists, and multiple processes can delete sessions from the shared SQLite database without coordination. The Ctrl+D keybind is triple-bound (app exit, session delete, input delete), creating the highest-risk accidental deletion path. The disk-cleanup.sh vector was the first confirmed root cause (now fixed), but the bug persists because at least two other vectors remain open.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Sessions exist in SQLite or they don't** - There is no "evicted but recoverable" state
    2. **NotFoundError = row deleted from DB** - Not a caching issue
    3. **Multiple processes share one SQLite DB** - No coordination protocol
    4. **Cascade deletes propagate silently** - Deleting a session kills all messages and parts
    5. **No "active session" lock exists** - Any process can delete any session at any time
    6. **JSON→SQLite migration is one-time** - Gate checks `opencode.db` existence, not whether sessions were imported. DB existed from Jan 27 schema migrations → 188 JSON sessions permanently orphaned, invisible to current code
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Untracked Session Deletion (Vector #2)
    
    **Symptom:** Interactive TUI session disappears mid-conversation with NotFoundError
    
    **Root cause:** `cleanUntrackedDiskSessions()` in `clean_cmd.go:408-539` finds sessions not tracked by any `.orch/workspace/*/session_id` file, checks if they were updated in the last 5 minutes, and deletes them if idle.
    
    **Why TUI sessions are vulnerable:**
    - Interactive/orchestrator TUI sessions have NO workspace directory
    - No `.session_id` file means Layer 1 protection is bypassed entirely
    - If the user hasn't sent a message in >5 minutes (reading, thinking, context switch), Layer 2 (recency) marks it as orphaned
    - Layer 3 (`IsSessionProcessing()`) only runs for recently-active sessions
    - Session gets deleted via `client.DeleteSession(session.ID)` at line 525
    
    **Code path:**
    ```
    orch clean --sessions (or --all)
      → cleanUntrackedDiskSessions()
        → !trackedSessionIDs[session.ID]  ← TUI has no workspace, always true
        → now.Sub(updatedAt) > 5min       ← User paused, true
        → (skips IsSessionProcessing)     ← Only checked for recent sessions
        → client.DeleteSession(session.ID) ← SESSION DELETED
    ```
    
    **Fix needed:** Call `IsSessionProcessing()` for ALL untracked sessions, not just recently active ones. Cost: one API call per untracked session.
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Accidental Ctrl+D Deletion (Vector #3)
    
    **Symptom:** Session vanishes after user presses Ctrl+D
    
    **Root cause:** Three keybinds share `ctrl+d`:
    - `app_exit: "ctrl+c,ctrl+d,<leader>q"` (config.ts:771)
    - `session_delete: "ctrl+d"` (config.ts:784)
    - `input_delete: "ctrl+d,delete,shift+delete"` (config.ts:878)
    
    **Why it happens:**
    1. User opens session list (`<leader>l`)
    2. User wants to exit the list, presses Ctrl+D (habit from terminal/vim)
    3. Session list dialog intercepts as `session_delete`, highlights session in red
    4. If user presses Ctrl+D again (common stutter or habit), session is permanently deleted
    5. TUI crashes with NotFoundError on next render cycle
    
    The confirmation ("Press ctrl+d again to confirm") is displayed as red-highlighted title text that may not be noticed in a fast interaction.
    
    **Fix needed:** Rebind `session_delete` to a non-conflicting key, or add a modal confirmation dialog.
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: External Process Deletion (Vector #4)
    
    **Symptom:** Session disappears without user action
    
    **Root cause:** `DELETE /session/:id` route has no authentication and no coordination. Any local process can delete

  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-13.
    Changed files: cmd/orch/serve_agents.go, pkg/verify/check.go, .beads/issues.jsonl.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Agent state exists across **four independent layers** (tmux windows, OpenCode in-memory, OpenCode on-disk, beads comments). These layers fall into two distinct categories: **state layers** (beads, workspace files) that represent what work was done, and **infrastructure layers** (OpenCode sessions, tmux windows) that represent transient execution resources. The dashboard reconciles these via a **Priority Cascade**: check beads issue status first (highest authority), then Phase comments, then registry state, then session existence. Status can appear "wrong" at the dashboard level while being "correct" at each individual layer - this is a measurement artifact from combining multiple sources of truth.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Phase: Complete is agent's declaration** - Only agent can reach this, not orchestrator
    2. **Beads issue closed = canonical completion** - All status queries defer to beads
    3. **Session existence ≠ agent still working** - Sessions persist indefinitely
    4. **Status checks don't mutate state** - Calculation is read-only, no side effects
    5. **Multiple sources must be reconciled** - No single source has complete truth
    6. **Tmux windows are UI layer only** - Not authoritative for state
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Dashboard Shows "Active" When Agent is Done
    
    **Symptom:** Dashboard shows agent as active, but `bd show <id>` says status=closed
    
    **Root cause:** Dashboard caching or SSE lag - hasn't received beads update yet
    
    **Why it happens:**
    
    - Agent reaches Phase: Complete
    - `orch complete` closes beads issue
    - Beads issue status = closed
    - Dashboard hasn't refreshed or polled beads yet
    - Dashboard still shows cached "active" state
    
    **Fix:** Refresh dashboard browser tab (forces beads query)
    
    **NOT the fix:** Deleting OpenCode session (treats symptom, not cause)
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: "Dead" Agents That Actually Completed
    
    **Symptom:** Dashboard shows "dead", but work is done and beads issue closed
    
    **Root cause:** Session cleanup happened before dashboard queried, cascade reached session check
    
    **Why it happens:**
    
    - Agent completed, beads issue closed
    - Session cleanup ran (manual or automatic)
    - Dashboard cascade: beads check → no issue (closed) → session check → no session → "dead"
    
    **Fix (Jan 8):** Priority Cascade puts beads/Phase check before session existence check
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Agent Went Idle But Not Complete
    
    **Symptom:** Session status is "idle" but no `Phase: Complete` comment
    
    **Root cause:** Agent ran out of context, crashed, or didn't follow completion protocol
    
    **Why it happens:**
    
    - Session exhausts context (150k tokens)
    - Agent stops responding
    - SSE event: `session.status = idle`
    - No `Phase: Complete` was ever written
    - Dashboard shows "idle" or "waiting"
    
    **This is expected behavior.** Session idle ≠ work complete. Only agents that explicitly run `bd comment <id> "Phase: Complete"` are considered done.
    
    **Fix:** Check workspace for what agent accomplished, then either:
    
    - `orch complete <id> --force` if work is done
    - `orch abandon <id>` if work is incomplete
    
    ### Failure Mode 4: Cross-Project Agents Not Visible
    
    **Symptom:** Agent spawned with `--workdir /other/project` doesn't appear in dashboard
    
    **Root cause:** Dashboard only scans current project's `.orch/workspace/` directory
    
    **Why it happens:**
    
    - Workspace created in `/other/project/.orch/workspace/`
    - Dashboard running from `orch-go` only sees `orch-go/.orch/workspace/`
    - Cross-project discovery requires querying OpenCode sessions for unique directories
    
    **Fix (Jan 6):** Multi-project workspace cache built from OpenCode session directories

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
Complete your session in this EXACT order:


1. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md** in your workspace with:
   - Plain-Language Summary (what was built/found)
   - Delta (what changed)
2. **COMMIT YOUR WORK:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: [brief description of changes]"
   ```
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session


⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.




CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-say-hello-exit-18feb-60c3/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.




## SKILL GUIDANCE (hello)

**IMPORTANT:** You have been spawned WITH this skill context already loaded.
You do NOT need to invoke this skill using the Skill tool.
Simply follow the guidance provided below.

---

---
name: hello
skill-type: procedure
audience: worker
spawnable: true
category: test
description: Simple test skill that prints hello and exits
allowed-tools:
- Bash
deliverables: []
verification:
  requirements: |
    - [ ] Agent printed "Hello from orch-go!"
  test_command: null
  required: true
---

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.

CONTEXT AVAILABLE:
- Global: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Project: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/CLAUDE.md

🚨 FINAL STEP - SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
Complete your session in this EXACT order:



1. Create SYNTHESIS.md in your workspace
2. **COMMIT YOUR WORK:** `git add -A && git commit -m "feat: [description]"`
3. `/exit`



⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
⚠️ Your work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported (or /exit for --no-track).
