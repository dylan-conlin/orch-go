TASK: Fix: global config backend: docker not being respected by orch spawn

## Problem
Set ~/.orch/config.yaml to backend: docker but orch spawn still defaults to opencode.

## Evidence
- ~/.orch/config.yaml contains: backend: docker
- orch spawn without --backend flag spawns headless opencode, not docker
- Global config IS being loaded (userconfig.Load() in spawn_cmd.go:1149)
- resolveBackend() receives globalCfg parameter

## Files to Check
- cmd/orch/backend.go - resolveBackend() function, priority chain
- cmd/orch/spawn_cmd.go - where resolveBackend is called
- pkg/userconfig/userconfig.go - Config struct and Load function

## Expected Behavior
When ~/.orch/config.yaml has backend: docker, spawns without explicit --backend flag should use docker.

## Debugging Steps
1. Add debug logging to see what globalCfg.Backend value is
2. Trace through resolveBackend() priority chain
3. Verify the Backend field is being read from YAML correctly
4. Fix the issue so global config is respected

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "global config backend"

### Prior Decisions
- Pre-spawn kb context should filter to orch ecosystem repos
  - Reason: 33% of global results are noise from unrelated repos (price-watch, dotfiles). Filtering preserves cross-repo signal while eliminating noise.
- ECOSYSTEM.md location is ~/.orch/ not ~/.claude/
  - Reason: Keeps orchestration docs with orchestration state; ~/.claude/ is for Claude-specific config
- Beads multi-repo hydration works correctly in v0.33.2
  - Reason: Config disconnect bug fixed in commit 634c0b93. Prior kn entry about 'buggy v0.29.0' is superseded.
- bd multi-repo config is YAML-only, database config is legacy
  - Reason: Fix commit 634c0b93 moved repos config from database to YAML. GetMultiRepoConfig() reads YAML only. Stale binary causes silent failure.
- Use existing stores for UI improvements over backend changes
  - Reason: All necessary data (errorEvents, agentlogEvents) already exists in frontend stores; UI-only changes are faster to implement and deploy
- Real-time UI updates via client-side SSE parsing
  - Reason: Parsing SSE events client-side (rather than polling API) provides instant updates without backend changes and scales better with many agents

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- Beads multi-repo config via bd repo add

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.





📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation fix-global-config-backend-docker` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-fix-global-config-backend-docker.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-debug-fix-global-config-20jan-2a4c/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

# Worker Base Patterns

**Purpose:** Common protocols shared by all worker skills. This is inherited by worker skills via dependencies.

**What this provides:**
- Authority delegation (what you can decide vs escalate)
- Beads progress tracking (how to report via bd comment)
- Phase reporting (how to signal transitions)
- Exit/completion protocol (how to properly end a session)

---

## Authority Delegation

**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

---

## Phase Reporting

**First 3 Actions (Critical):**
Within your first 3 tool calls, you MUST:
1. Report via `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

**Status Updates:**
Update Status: field in your workspace/investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed)

**Signal orchestrator when blocked:**
- Add `**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]` to workspace
- Add `**Status:** QUESTION - [question]` when needing input

---

## Session Complete Protocol

**When your work is done (all deliverables ready), complete in this EXACT order:**

{{if eq .Tier "light"}}
1. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
2. Commit any final changes
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

**Light Tier:** SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.
{{else}}
1. Run: `bd comment {{.BeadsID}} "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"` (report phase FIRST - before commit)
2. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created
3. Commit all changes (including SYNTHESIS.md)
4. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session
{{end}}

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility even if the agent dies before committing.

**Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.**
The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.

# Systematic Debugging

## Summary

Four-phase debugging framework: Root Cause → Pattern Analysis → Hypothesis Testing → Implementation. Core principle: understand before fixing.

---

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

---

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue: test failures, production bugs, unexpected behavior, performance problems, build failures, integration issues.

**Use ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- Previous fixes didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

---

## Quick Reference

1. Check if specialized technique applies (see patterns section)
2. Check console/logs for errors - error may already be captured
3. Phase 1: Root cause investigation (understand WHAT and WHY)
4. Phase 2: Pattern analysis (working vs broken differences)
5. Phase 3: Hypothesis testing (form and test specific theory)
6. Phase 4: Implementation (failing test, fix root cause, verify)
7. Document and complete

**Red flag:** If thinking "quick fix for now" → STOP, return to Phase 1.

## Error Visibility (BEFORE Phase 1)

Check if errors have already been logged before investigating:

```bash
# Check project-specific error logs
tail -50 *.log 2>/dev/null
# Check build/test output
make test 2>&1 | tail -30
# Check runtime logs (if applicable)
docker logs <container> --tail 50 2>/dev/null
```

**If logs show relevant errors:**
1. Copy error details to investigation file
2. Use as starting point for Phase 1
3. You may already have root cause evidence

**If empty or unhelpful:** Proceed to Phase 1.

---

## Common Debugging Patterns

Before starting Phase 1, identify if a specialized technique applies:

| Pattern | Symptoms | Technique |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Deep call stack** | Error deep in execution, origin unclear, data corruption propagated | [techniques/root-cause-tracing.md](techniques/root-cause-tracing.md) |
| **Timing-dependent** | Flaky tests, race conditions, arbitrary timeouts, "works locally fails in CI" | [techniques/condition-based-waiting.md](techniques/condition-based-waiting.md) |
| **Invalid data propagation** | Bad data causes failures far from source, missing validation | [techniques/defense-in-depth.md](techniques/defense-in-depth.md) |

Load the appropriate technique for specialized guidance.

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**Goal:** Understand WHAT and WHY

**Load:** [phases/phase1-root-cause.md](phases/phase1-root-cause.md)

Key activities:
- Read error messages carefully (stack traces completely)
- Reproduce consistently
- Check recent changes AND pattern recognition (whack-a-mole detection)
- In multi-component systems: add diagnostic instrumentation before fixing
- Trace data flow to source

**Success criteria:** You understand root cause, not just symptoms

---

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Goal:** Identify differences between working and broken

**Load:** [phases/phase2-pattern-analysis.md](phases/phase2-pattern-analysis.md)

Key activities:
- Find working examples in same codebase
- Read reference implementations COMPLETELY (don't skim)
- List every difference, however small
- Understand dependencies and assumptions

**Success criteria:** You know what's different and why it matters

---

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Goal:** Form and test specific hypothesis

**Load:** [phases/phase3-hypothesis-testing.md](phases/phase3-hypothesis-testing.md)

Key activities:
- Form single hypothesis: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
- Test minimally (one variable at a time)
- Verify before continuing - didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis, don't add more fixes

**Success criteria:** Hypothesis confirmed or new hypothesis formed

---

### Phase 4: Implementation

**Goal:** Fix root cause, not symptom

**Load:** [phases/phase4-implementation.md](phases/phase4-implementation.md)

Key activities:
- Create failing test case
- Implement single fix
- **Smoke-test end-to-end** (critical - see below)
- If 3+ fixes failed: question architecture

**Success criteria:** Bug resolved, tests pass, smoke-test confirms real fix

---

## Smoke-Test Requirement

**Before claiming fix is complete, you MUST:**
1. Run the actual failing scenario that triggered debugging
2. Verify expected behavior now occurs
3. Document smoke-test in completion comment

**Valid:** "Bug: CLI crashes on --mcp" → Run `orch spawn --mcp`, verify no crash
**Invalid:** "Unit tests pass" (necessary but not sufficient)

**If cannot smoke-test:** Document WHY in completion comment.

## Visual Debugging Tools

### snap - Screenshot CLI (Recommended)

```bash
snap                          # Capture screen, returns file path
snap list --json              # Find window IDs
snap window "Firefox"         # Capture by app name
snap --json                   # JSON output: {"path": "/path/to/screenshot.png"}
```

**Use for:** Verifying UI state, documenting visual bugs, smoke-testing UI changes.

**Advantage:** Zero context cost (returns file path, not image data).

### Browser Automation

**USE:** Glass MCP - connects to your actual Chrome tabs via DevTools Protocol

**FALLBACK:** Playwright MCP - for headless/CI scenarios

**AVOID:** browser-use MCP - causes context explosion (screenshots, full DOM)

**Decision flow:**
1. Need visual verification? → `snap` (zero context cost)
2. Need browser automation (clicking, typing, DOM inspection)? → Glass MCP (spawned with --mcp glass)
3. Need headless/CI testing? → Playwright MCP
4. Need DevTools console errors? → Glass MCP (glass_page_state tool)

**Glass advantages:**
- Connects to your actual Chrome (not headless)
- Auto-check DevTools console errors
- Inspect live DOM state
- CLI commands for validation gates (glass assert)

## Investigation File (Optional for Simple Bugs)

Investigation files are **recommended** for complex bugs but **optional** for simple fixes.

### When to Create

**Create when:**
- Multi-step root cause analysis needed
- Multiple hypotheses to test
- Findings should be preserved
- Pattern may recur (for synthesis)

**Skip when:**
- Bug is obvious and localized (typo, wrong variable)
- Fix completes in <15 minutes
- Root cause immediately clear from error
- Commit message can fully document fix

### Create Template (if needed)

```bash
kb create investigation "debug/topic-in-kebab-case"
```

**After creating:**
1. Fill Question field with specific bug description
2. Document findings progressively during Phases 1-4
3. Update Confidence and Resolution-Status as you progress
4. Set Resolution-Status when complete (Resolved/Mitigated/Recurring)

### Commits-Only Completion

If skipping investigation file, ensure descriptive commits:
- Include "why" not just "what"
- Example: `fix: handle null session in auth middleware - was causing silent failures when Redis connection dropped`

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

After implementing fix, perform self-review before completion.

### Pattern Scope Verification

**If bug was a pattern that could exist elsewhere:**

```bash
# Check for pattern occurrences
rg "bug_pattern"                    # Should be 0 or documented exceptions
rg "range\(len\(" --type py         # Off-by-one example
rg "timeout.*=.*[0-9]" --type py    # Hardcoded timeout example
```

**Skip if:** Bug was truly one-off (typo, unique logic error).

### Debugging-Specific Checks

| Check | If Failed |
|-------|-----------|
| Root cause addressed (not symptom) | Return to Phase 1 |
| No debug code left (console.log, print) | Remove before commit |
| No temporary workarounds ("TODO: fix properly") | Complete the fix |
| Regression test exists | Add test |
| Investigation documented | Update file |

### Standard Checks

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Conventional commit format (`fix:`, `test:`)
- [ ] Atomic commits

### Discovered Work

If you found related bugs, tech debt, or strategic unknowns:

```bash
bd create "description" --type bug    # or --type task
bd create "description" --type question # for architectural/premise questions
bd label <id> triage:review           # default label for review
```

**Note "No discovered work" in completion if nothing found.**

## Fix-Verify-Fix Cycle (Atomic Debugging)

**Fix + Verify = One Unit of Work**

Do NOT:
- Implement fix → claim complete → wait for new spawn if fails
- "Fix is done, verification is a separate task"

DO:
- Implement fix → verify immediately → if fails, iterate
- Only claim complete when smoke-test passes

### When to Iterate vs Escalate

**Keep iterating if:**
- Verification reveals related issue in same area
- Fix was incomplete but direction correct
- You understand why it failed

**Escalate if:**
- 3+ fix attempts failed (questioning architecture needed)
- Root cause was misidentified (return to Phase 1)
- Issue outside your scope/authority

### Reporting During Iteration

---

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals new problem in different place

**ALL mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Completion Criteria

Before marking complete, verify ALL:

- [ ] **Root cause identified** - Documented in investigation OR commit message
- [ ] **Fix implemented** - Addresses root cause, not symptoms
- [ ] **Tests passing** - Including reproduction test, with **actual test output documented**
- [ ] **Smoke-test passed** - Actual failing scenario now works
- [ ] **Self-review passed** - Pattern scope, no debug code, no workarounds
- [ ] **Discovered work reviewed** - Tracked or noted "No discoveries"
- [ ] **Phase reported with test evidence** - `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Tests: <cmd> - <output>"` (BEFORE final commit)
- [ ] **Git clean** - `git status` shows "nothing to commit"

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

### After All Criteria Met (in this EXACT order)

**Test Evidence Requirement:**
- Format: `Tests: <command> - <actual output summary>`
- Good: `Tests: go test ./... - 23 passed, 0 failed`
- Good: `Tests: npm test - 15 specs, 0 failures`
- Bad: `Tests passing` (no command, no numbers)

**Why:** `orch complete` validates test evidence in comments. Vague claims trigger manual verification.

**Why this order matters:** If the agent dies after commit but before reporting Phase: Complete, the orchestrator cannot detect completion. Reporting phase first ensures visibility.

**Note:** `bd close` is removed from agent responsibilities - only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.

---

## Fast-Path Alternative

For clearly localized, trivial failures (import path error, undefined name, obvious single-file fix):

Use `quick-debugging` skill instead. It provides lightweight loop with strict escalation back to systematic-debugging if first attempt fails.

**Use quick-debugging when:**
- Scope ≤ 2 files and ≤ 1 hour
- Error points directly at fix location
- No architectural uncertainty

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question architecture, return to Phase 1.
