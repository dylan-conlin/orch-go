## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "test backend selection"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- External integrations require manual smoke test before Phase: Complete
  - Reason: OAuth feature shipped with passing tests but failed real-world use. Tests couldn't cover actual OAuth flow with Anthropic.
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification

### Prior Decisions
- Refactor shell-out functions for testability
  - Reason: Extracting command construction into Build*Command functions allows unit testing of logic without side effects
- Temporal density and repeated constraints are highest value reflection signals
  - Reason: Low noise, high actionability - tested against real kn/kb data
- Constraint validity tested by implementation, not age
  - Reason: Constraints become outdated when code contradicts them (implementation supersession), not when time passes. Test with rg before assuming constraint holds.
- Tmux is the default spawn mode in orch-go, not headless
  - Reason: Testing and code inspection confirmed tmux is default (main.go:1042), CLAUDE.md documentation was incorrect
- CreateSession API now accepts model parameter for headless spawns
  - Reason: Headless mode was missing model selection capability - added Model field to CreateSessionRequest struct and threaded through CreateSession function to achieve parity with inline/tmux modes
- Use existing stores for UI improvements over backend changes
  - Reason: All necessary data (errorEvents, agentlogEvents) already exists in frontend stores; UI-only changes are faster to implement and deploy
- Real-time UI updates via client-side SSE parsing
  - Reason: Parsing SSE events client-side (rather than polling API) provides instant updates without backend changes and scales better with many agents
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- OpenCode model selection is per-message, not per-session
  - Reason: Intentional design enabling mid-conversation model switching, cost optimization, and flexibility. Pass model to prompt/message calls, not session creation.
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.

- Completion Verification Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/completion-verification.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-14.
    Changed files: pkg/verify/check.go, pkg/verify/visual.go, .beads/issues.jsonl.
    Deleted files: pkg/verify/phase.go, pkg/verify/evidence.go, cmd/orch/complete.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Completion verification operates through **three independent gates** (Phase, Evidence, Approval) that check different aspects of "done". Phase gate verifies agent claims completion, Evidence gate requires visual/test proof in beads comments, Approval gate (UI changes only) requires human sign-off. Verification is **tier-aware**: light tier checks Phase + commits, full tier adds SYNTHESIS.md, orchestrator tier checks SESSION_HANDOFF.md instead. The **5-tier escalation model** surfaces knowledge-producing work (investigation/architect/research) for mandatory orchestrator review before auto-closing. Cross-project detection uses SPAWN_CONTEXT.md to determine which directory to verify in. **Targeted bypasses** (`--skip-{gate} "reason"`) replace blanket `--force`, allowing specific gates to be skipped while others still run.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Evidence Gate False Positive
    
    
    **What happens:** Agent passes Evidence gate without actual visual verification.
    
    **Root cause:** Agent generates screenshot placeholder text ("Screenshot attached") without actually attaching screenshot. Evidence gate searches for keyword "screenshot", finds it, passes.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Text-based keyword matching can't distinguish placeholder from actual proof.
    
    **Fix:** Approval gate for UI changes. Even if Evidence passes, human must verify via --approve.
    
    **Why this matters:** False positive on Evidence gate means broken UI ships thinking it's verified.
    
    ### 2. Approval Gate Bypass
    
    **What happens:** Non-UI changes accidentally avoid approval gate.
    
    **Root cause:** File path detection (`modifiedWebFiles()`) misclassifies files. `web-utils/` not under `web/`, approval skipped.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** File structure varies across projects. Heuristics (path contains "web") can miss edge cases.
    
    **Fix:** Explicit skill-based detection. `feature-impl` with UI flag requires approval, regardless of file paths.
    
    **Future:** Skill manifest declares "requires_ui_approval: true".
    
    ### 3. Cross-Project Verification Wrong Directory
    
    **What happens:** Verification runs in wrong directory, checks wrong tests, reports false failure.
    
    **Root cause:** `SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` missing PROJECT_DIR, fallback uses workspace location (orch-go), but agent worked in orch-cli.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Workspace location != work location. No guaranteed signal of where work happened.
    
    **Fix:** `orch spawn --workdir` explicitly sets PROJECT_DIR in SPAWN_CONTEXT.md. Verification reads it.
    
    **Prevention:** Make --workdir mandatory for cross-project spawns, fail spawn if missing.

    Deleted files: ~/.claude/skills/meta/orchestrator/SKILL.md.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Anthropic restricts Opus 4.5 access via fingerprinting that blocks API usage but allows Claude Code CLI with Max subscription. This constraint forced a **dual spawn architecture**: primary path (OpenCode API + Sonnet/Flash, headless, high concurrency) and escape hatch (Claude CLI + Opus, tmux, crash-resistant). The escape hatch exists because critical infrastructure work (fixing the spawn system itself) can't depend on what might fail. Model choice now encodes reliability requirements, not just quality preferences.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Never spawn OpenCode infrastructure work without --backend claude --tmux**
       - Violation: Agent kills itself mid-execution when server restarts
    
    2. **Infrastructure detection runs before model auto-selection**
       - Priority 2.5 (between explicit flags and model-based selection)
       - Ensures auto-apply happens even without explicit --backend
    
    3. **Opus only accessible via Claude CLI backend**
       - API requests to Opus fail with auth error
       - Fingerprinting checks more than headers (TLS, HTTP/2 frames, ordering)
    
    4. **Escape hatch provides true independence**
       - Claude CLI binary ≠ OpenCode server
       - Tmux session persists across service restarts
       - Different authentication path (Max subscription OAuth)
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Zombie Agents (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Agents tracked in registry but never actually ran
    
    **Root Cause:** Spawning with `--model opus` before understanding auth gate
    - orch created registry entry
    - OpenCode session created
    - Anthropic rejected API request (fingerprinting)
    - Agent hung in "running" state
    - Consumed concurrency slot without doing work
    
    **Examples:**
    - orch-go-mo0ja, orch-go-pzi2i, orch-go-aoei0, orch-go-gd1gd, orch-go-lwc3o
    
    **Fix:** Never use `--model opus` without `--backend claude`
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Header Injection Conflicts (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Gemini Flash spawns hung after attempting Opus bypass
    
    **Root Cause:** Injected Claude Code headers (`x-app: cli`, `anthropic-version`, etc.) into OpenCode's Anthropic provider
    - Bypassed Opus gate (didn't work)
    - Broke Gemini spawns (headers conflicted with Bun fetch/SDK)
    - System-wide impact from localized change
    
    **Lesson:** Fingerprinting is more sophisticated than headers alone
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Infrastructure Work Kills Itself
    
    **Symptom:** Agent fixing OpenCode server crashes mid-execution
    
    **Root Cause:** Agent spawned via OpenCode API, agent's fix restarts OpenCode server, agent's session killed
    
    **Solution:** Infrastructure work detection auto-applies `--backend claude --tmux`
    
    **Why auto-detection matters:**
    - Humans forget to add flags manually
    - Task description might not mention "opencode" explicitly
    - Keyword scan catches common patterns
    - Escape hatch becomes invisible safety net

- Phase 4 Review: Model Pattern at N=11
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/PHASE4_REVIEW.md
  - Summary:
    **At N=11, the model pattern shows exceptional consistency and proven utility.** All 11 models converged on the 6-section structure without enforcement. The enable/constrain query works across every domain tested. Most significantly: **the models that emerged reveal your cognitive investment priorities** - hot paths (spawn, agent, dashboard), strategic understanding (orchestrator, daemon), and owned complexity (completion, beads integration).
    
    **Key finding:** High investigation count + model existence = **friction that refused to resolve**. The absence of models for external dependencies (kb, tmux) despite high investigation counts reveals clear ownership boundaries.

- Coaching Plugin
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/coaching-plugin.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-14 (worker detection fix verified).
    Changed files: plugins/coaching.ts, cmd/orch/serve_coaching.go, pkg/opencode/client.go.
    Deleted files: ~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The Coaching Plugin is an OpenCode plugin that provides real-time behavioral feedback to orchestrators and workers through tool usage pattern detection. It implements the "Pain as Signal" architectural pattern: agents should feel friction in real-time rather than learning about it post-hoc.
    
    The plugin hooks `tool.execute.after` to observe tool usage patterns (it cannot see LLM response text—fundamental constraint), detects 8 behavioral patterns using behavioral proxies (action ratio, analysis paralysis, frame collapse, etc.), and injects coaching messages via `client.session.prompt({ noReply: true })`. Metrics persist to `~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl` and are exposed via `/api/coaching` for dashboard visualization.
    
    **Current status (Feb 2026):** Both orchestrator and worker coaching operational. Orchestrator coaching: 1000+ metrics collected. Worker health tracking: verified working Feb 14 — stress test (50+ tool calls) emitted `context_usage` worker metric with zero orchestrator metric leakage. Fix required two opencode fork commits (459a1bfba, 0922edfe7) to: (1) read `x-opencode-env-ORCH_WORKER` header and set `session.metadata.role='worker'`, (2) pass `session.metadata` through `tool.execute.after` plugin hooks. **Note:** Worker detection only works for headless (OpenCode HTTP API) spawns — Claude CLI/tmux spawns bypass the HTTP session creation endpoint and don't get metadata set.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Plugins cannot see LLM response text** - Only tool calls visible, not free-text responses. Fundamental constraint, not fixable.
    2. **Behavioral proxies are the only detection mechanism** - All pattern detection uses tool usage as proxy signals.
    3. **Metrics persist, session state doesn't** - JSONL file survives restarts, in-memory Map is ephemeral.
    4. **Observation coupled to intervention** - Injection only fires from `flushMetrics` within `tool.execute.after` hook.
    5. **Worker detection caching is one-way** - Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`.
    6. **Two injection mechanisms serve different purposes** - `config.instructions` adds file references at config time (static context like skills), `client.session.prompt(noReply: true)` injects content at runtime (immediate coaching).
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Worker Detection Caching Bug (Jan 10-17)
    
    **Symptom:** Zero worker health metrics in production despite implemented code
    
    **Root cause:** `detectWorkerSession()` cached both `true` AND `false` results, permanently misclassifying workers if ANY tool call happened before a worker-identifying signal
    
    **Why it happens:**
    1. Worker session starts, first tool = `glob` (no detection signal)
    2. `isWorker = false` → cached → function returns `false` forever
    3. Second tool = `read SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` → cached result returned, detection skipped
    4. Worker treated as orchestrator for entire session
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    First non-matching tool call → cache false → subsequent detection signals ignored → worker health code never runs
    ```
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`. Allow re-evaluation on each tool call until worker confirmed.
    
    **Pattern established:** "Never cache negative results in per-session detection"
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Invalid Detection Signal (Bash workdir)
    
    **Symptom:** Detection code exists but never fires
    
    **Root cause:** Detection checked for `args.workdir` on bash tool, but bash tool has no `workdir` argument
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Bash tool args are: `command`, `timeout`, `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `run_in_background`
    - No `workdir` argument exists
    - Detection signal `if (tool === "bash" && args?.workdir)` never matches
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Removed broken detection signal, restored file-path detection for any `.orch/workspace/` path
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Observation Coupled to Intervention (Restart Brittleness)
    
    **Symptom:** Coaching messages stop after OpenCode server restart, even though metrics show problems
    
    **Root cause:** Injection is implemented as side effect of metric collection, not as separate concern that can operate independently
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Metrics are **persistent** (JSONL file, survive restart)
    - Session state is **in-memory** (Map, lost on restart)
    - Injection logic **coupled to metric collection** (only happens via `flushMetrics`)
    - After restart: metrics file shows "poor" status, but no session state exists, so injection never fires
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    Server restart → session state lost → flushMetrics not called → injection doesn't fire → coaching stops
    ```
    
    **Architectural fix (not yet implemented):** Separate injection into independent daemon that reads metrics from JSONL and injects via OpenCode API, completely decoupled

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session





CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-test-backend-selection-18feb-955d/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.




## SKILL GUIDANCE (hello)

**IMPORTANT:** You have been spawned WITH this skill context already loaded.
You do NOT need to invoke this skill using the Skill tool.
Simply follow the guidance provided below.

---

---
name: hello
skill-type: procedure
audience: worker
spawnable: true
category: test
description: Simple test skill that prints hello and exits
allowed-tools:
- Bash
deliverables: []
verification:
  requirements: |
    - [ ] Agent printed "Hello from orch-go!"
  test_command: null
  required: true
---

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.
