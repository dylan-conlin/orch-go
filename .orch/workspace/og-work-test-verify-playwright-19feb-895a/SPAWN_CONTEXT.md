SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## CONFIG RESOLUTION

- Backend: opencode (source: cli-flag)
- Model: openai/gpt-5.2-codex (source: cli-flag)
- Tier: full (source: heuristic (skill-default))
- Spawn Mode: headless (source: default)
- MCP: playwright (source: cli-flag)
- Mode: tdd (source: default)
- Validation: tests (source: default)




## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "test verify playwright"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- orch complete must verify SYNTHESIS.md exists and is not placeholder before closing issue
  - Reason: 70% of agents completed without synthesis in 24h chaos period
- External integrations require manual smoke test before Phase: Complete
  - Reason: OAuth feature shipped with passing tests but failed real-world use. Tests couldn't cover actual OAuth flow with Anthropic.
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification

### Prior Decisions
- orch spawn context delivery is reliable
  - Reason: Verified that SPAWN_CONTEXT.md is correctly populated and accessible by the agent
- Refactor shell-out functions for testability
  - Reason: Extracting command construction into Build*Command functions allows unit testing of logic without side effects
- Temporal density and repeated constraints are highest value reflection signals
  - Reason: Low noise, high actionability - tested against real kn/kb data
- Constraint validity tested by implementation, not age
  - Reason: Constraints become outdated when code contradicts them (implementation supersession), not when time passes. Test with rg before assuming constraint holds.
- When spawned for cross-repo work, verify work completion status before starting
  - Reason: Task orch-go-oo1f: spawned in orch-go for work in orch-knowledge. Template was already retired (commit 7430185) before agent fully engaged. Quick verification could have saved agent context.
- Tmux is the default spawn mode in orch-go, not headless
  - Reason: Testing and code inspection confirmed tmux is default (main.go:1042), CLAUDE.md documentation was incorrect
- Headless spawn mode is production-ready
  - Reason: All 5 requirements verified working: status detection, monitoring, completion detection, error handling, user visibility. Investigation orch-go-0r2q confirmed no blockers exist.
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- Layer 2 skill constraint verification already implemented in orch-go
  - Reason: pkg/verify/constraint.go (211 lines) parses SKILL-CONSTRAINTS block from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md and verifies required/optional patterns via VerifyCompletionFull()
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.

- Completion Verification Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/completion-verification.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-14.
    Changed files: pkg/verify/check.go, pkg/verify/visual.go, .beads/issues.jsonl.
    Deleted files: pkg/verify/phase.go, pkg/verify/evidence.go, cmd/orch/complete.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Completion verification operates through **three independent gates** (Phase, Evidence, Approval) that check different aspects of "done". Phase gate verifies agent claims completion, Evidence gate requires visual/test proof in beads comments, Approval gate (UI changes only) requires human sign-off. Verification is **tier-aware**: light tier checks Phase + commits, full tier adds SYNTHESIS.md, orchestrator tier checks SESSION_HANDOFF.md instead. The **5-tier escalation model** surfaces knowledge-producing work (investigation/architect/research) for mandatory orchestrator review before auto-closing. Cross-project detection uses SPAWN_CONTEXT.md to determine which directory to verify in. **Targeted bypasses** (`--skip-{gate} "reason"`) replace blanket `--force`, allowing specific gates to be skipped while others still run.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Evidence Gate False Positive
    
    
    **What happens:** Agent passes Evidence gate without actual visual verification.
    
    **Root cause:** Agent generates screenshot placeholder text ("Screenshot attached") without actually attaching screenshot. Evidence gate searches for keyword "screenshot", finds it, passes.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Text-based keyword matching can't distinguish placeholder from actual proof.
    
    **Fix:** Approval gate for UI changes. Even if Evidence passes, human must verify via --approve.
    
    **Why this matters:** False positive on Evidence gate means broken UI ships thinking it's verified.
    
    ### 2. Approval Gate Bypass
    
    **What happens:** Non-UI changes accidentally avoid approval gate.
    
    **Root cause:** File path detection (`modifiedWebFiles()`) misclassifies files. `web-utils/` not under `web/`, approval skipped.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** File structure varies across projects. Heuristics (path contains "web") can miss edge cases.
    
    **Fix:** Explicit skill-based detection. `feature-impl` with UI flag requires approval, regardless of file paths.
    
    **Future:** Skill manifest declares "requires_ui_approval: true".
    
    ### 3. Cross-Project Verification Wrong Directory
    
    **What happens:** Verification runs in wrong directory, checks wrong tests, reports false failure.
    
    **Root cause:** `SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` missing PROJECT_DIR, fallback uses workspace location (orch-go), but agent worked in orch-cli.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Workspace location != work location. No guaranteed signal of where work happened.
    
    **Fix:** `orch spawn --workdir` explicitly sets PROJECT_DIR in SPAWN_CONTEXT.md. Verification reads it.
    
    **Prevention:** Make --workdir mandatory for cross-project spawns, fail spawn if missing.

- macOS Click Freeze
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/macos-click-freeze.md
  - Summary:
    Trackpad clicks stop registering while cursor movement and keyboard continue working. `sudo killall -HUP WindowServer` fixes it every time (HUP = reconfigure, not restart). This points to WindowServer accumulating corrupted state in its click event pipeline. **Breakthrough in Session 15:** nuclear elimination of ~23 services stopped the freeze. **Freeze returned (2026-02-13)** after gradual service re-enablement — first recurrence in ~2 days. **However (2026-02-14):** the same service set that triggered the Feb 13 freeze ran stable for 5+ hours, suggesting the freeze is **intermittent/stochastic** rather than deterministic. Frequency has decreased from every ~15 min (Sessions 11-14) to rare occurrences. macOS updated to 15.7.4 (from 15.6.1) between sessions. **H6 (aggregate service contention) remains the leading hypothesis** but is weakened by the stability observation. **New approach:** reactive capture script (`scripts/click-freeze-capture.sh`) to snapshot full system state during freeze occurrences for correlation analysis, rather than disruptive elimination testing.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Hypothesis 1: yabai event interception corrupts WindowServer state — WEAKENED (RE-TESTING NEEDED)
    
    yabai uses the macOS Accessibility API to manage windows. Freeze recurred with yabai fully stopped in Session 14 (`yabai --stop-service`, confirmed no process via `pgrep`).
    
    **Evidence against:** Freeze recurred within ~30 minutes with yabai completely stopped (Session 14). No yabai process running. Seemed eliminated.
    
    **Evidence for re-testing (Session 16):** The Session 14 elimination was a single 30-min test with everything else still running. The environment is now different — yabai is running with a reduced service set (NI/Ollama gone, many agents disabled). yabai may not be the sole cause but could be a necessary component of H6 (aggregate contention). Worth re-testing by stopping yabai in current environment.
    
    ### Hypothesis 2: Karabiner DriverKit drops click events at kernel level — ELIMINATED
    
    Karabiner was fully uninstalled (app removed, DriverKit extension gone, no IOKit registry entries, no LaunchAgents). Freeze persisted immediately after fresh reboot with no Karabiner components present.
    
    **Evidence against:** Completely uninstalled — no process, no DriverKit extension (`systemextensionsctl list` clean), no IOKit entries (`ioreg` clean), no LaunchAgents. Freeze still occurred immediately post-reboot. Definitively eliminated.
    
    ### Hypothesis 3: WindowServer internal corruption (no external cause) — WEAKENED
    
    macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia) may have a bug where WindowServer's click event routing table gets corrupted over time. This would be independent of any third-party software.
    
    **Evidence for:** Would explain why eliminating multiple apps in Session 11 didn't fix it.
    
    **Evidence against:** Three research probes (2026-02-11) searched GitHub, Reddit, Apple Discussions exhaustively — **zero matching reports** for this symptom pattern (clicks stop, cursor moves, HUP fixes). If this were a Sequoia bug, community reports would exist. This significantly weakens H3.
    
    ### Hypothesis 4: Memory pressure from OpenCode instance accumulation — EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
    
    OpenCode accumulates instances (with LSP/MCP/file watchers) per unique project directory. Each instance costs 300-500MB for LSP alone.
    
    **Evidence against (Session 15):**
    - Freeze occurred **immediately after fresh reboot** — memory was abundant, OpenCode hadn't even started yet
    - This strongly suggests memory pressure is NOT the primary cause
    - After disabling ~23 services,

- Coaching Plugin
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/coaching-plugin.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-14 (worker detection fix verified).
    Changed files: plugins/coaching.ts, cmd/orch/serve_coaching.go, pkg/opencode/client.go, web/src/routes/+page.svelte.
    Deleted files: ~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The Coaching Plugin is an OpenCode plugin that provides real-time behavioral feedback to orchestrators and workers through tool usage pattern detection. It implements the "Pain as Signal" architectural pattern: agents should feel friction in real-time rather than learning about it post-hoc.
    
    The plugin hooks `tool.execute.after` to observe tool usage patterns (it cannot see LLM response text—fundamental constraint), detects 8 behavioral patterns using behavioral proxies (action ratio, analysis paralysis, frame collapse, etc.), and injects coaching messages via `client.session.prompt({ noReply: true })`. Metrics persist to `~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl` and are exposed via `/api/coaching` for dashboard visualization.
    
    **Current status (Feb 2026):** Both orchestrator and worker coaching operational. Orchestrator coaching: 1000+ metrics collected. Worker health tracking: verified working Feb 14 — stress test (50+ tool calls) emitted `context_usage` worker metric with zero orchestrator metric leakage. Fix required two opencode fork commits (459a1bfba, 0922edfe7) to: (1) read `x-opencode-env-ORCH_WORKER` header and set `session.metadata.role='worker'`, (2) pass `session.metadata` through `tool.execute.after` plugin hooks. **Note:** Worker detection only works for headless (OpenCode HTTP API) spawns — Claude CLI/tmux spawns bypass the HTTP session creation endpoint and don't get metadata set.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Plugins cannot see LLM response text** - Only tool calls visible, not free-text responses. Fundamental constraint, not fixable.
    2. **Behavioral proxies are the only detection mechanism** - All pattern detection uses tool usage as proxy signals.
    3. **Metrics persist, session state doesn't** - JSONL file survives restarts, in-memory Map is ephemeral.
    4. **Observation coupled to intervention** - Injection only fires from `flushMetrics` within `tool.execute.after` hook.
    5. **Worker detection caching is one-way** - Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`.
    6. **Two injection mechanisms serve different purposes** - `config.instructions` adds file references at config time (static context like skills), `client.session.prompt(noReply: true)` injects content at runtime (immediate coaching).
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Worker Detection Caching Bug (Jan 10-17)
    
    **Symptom:** Zero worker health metrics in production despite implemented code
    
    **Root cause:** `detectWorkerSession()` cached both `true` AND `false` results, permanently misclassifying workers if ANY tool call happened before a worker-identifying signal
    
    **Why it happens:**
    1. Worker session starts, first tool = `glob` (no detection signal)
    2. `isWorker = false` → cached → function returns `false` forever
    3. Second tool = `read SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` → cached result returned, detection skipped
    4. Worker treated as orchestrator for entire session
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    First non-matching tool call → cache false → subsequent detection signals ignored → worker health code never runs
    ```
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`. Allow re-evaluation on each tool call until worker confirmed.
    
    **Pattern established:** "Never cache negative results in per-session detection"
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Invalid Detection Signal (Bash workdir)
    
    **Symptom:** Detection code exists but never fires
    
    **Root cause:** Detection checked for `args.workdir` on bash tool, but bash tool has no `workdir` argument
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Bash tool args are: `command`, `timeout`, `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `run_in_background`
    - No `workdir` argument exists
    - Detection signal `if (tool === "bash" && args?.workdir)` never matches
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Removed broken detection signal, restored file-path detection for any `.orch/workspace/` path
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Observation Coupled to Intervention (Restart Brittleness)
    
    **Symptom:** Coaching messages stop after OpenCode server restart, even though metrics show problems
    
    **Root cause:** Injection is implemented as side effect of metric collection, not as separate concern that can operate independently
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Metrics are **persistent** (JSONL file, survive restart)
    - Session state is **in-memory** (Map, lost on restart)
    - Injection logic **coupled to metric collection** (only happens via `flushMetrics`)
    - After restart: metrics file shows "poor" status, but no session state exists, so injection never fires
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    Server restart → session state lost → flushMetrics not called → injection doesn't fire → coaching stops
    ```
    
    **Architectural fix (not yet implemented):** Separate injection into independent daemon that reads metrics from JSONL and injects via OpenCode API, completely decoupled

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- orch clean to remove ghost sessions automatically

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
Complete your session in this EXACT order:

⚠️ **NEVER use git add -A or git add .** — the workspace often has unrelated changes (.autorebuild.lock, .beads/, build/).
Stage ONLY the specific files you created or modified for your task, by name.


1. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md** in your workspace with:
   - Plain-Language Summary (what was built/found)
   - Delta (what changed)
2. **COMMIT YOUR WORK:**
   ```bash
   git add <files you changed>
   git commit -m "feat: [brief description of changes]"
   ```
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session


⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.




CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-test-verify-playwright-19feb-895a/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.
