TASK: test docker kb bd fixed


SPAWN TIER: light

⚡ LIGHT TIER: This is a lightweight spawn. SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required.
   Focus on completing the task efficiently. Skip session synthesis documentation.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "test docker fixed"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- External integrations require manual smoke test before Phase: Complete
  - Reason: OAuth feature shipped with passing tests but failed real-world use. Tests couldn't cover actual OAuth flow with Anthropic.
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification

### Prior Decisions
- Refactor shell-out functions for testability
  - Reason: Extracting command construction into Build*Command functions allows unit testing of logic without side effects
- Temporal density and repeated constraints are highest value reflection signals
  - Reason: Low noise, high actionability - tested against real kn/kb data
- Constraint validity tested by implementation, not age
  - Reason: Constraints become outdated when code contradicts them (implementation supersession), not when time passes. Test with rg before assuming constraint holds.
- Multi-repo hydration requires healthy database
  - Reason: Orphaned dependencies in kb-cli blocked all database operations including multi-repo sync. Fix with 'bd doctor --fix' before attempting multi-repo setup.
- Beads multi-repo hydration works correctly in v0.33.2
  - Reason: Config disconnect bug fixed in commit 634c0b93. Prior kn entry about 'buggy v0.29.0' is superseded.
- bd multi-repo config is YAML-only, database config is legacy
  - Reason: Fix commit 634c0b93 moved repos config from database to YAML. GetMultiRepoConfig() reads YAML only. Stale binary causes silent failure.
- Tmux is the default spawn mode in orch-go, not headless
  - Reason: Testing and code inspection confirmed tmux is default (main.go:1042), CLAUDE.md documentation was incorrect
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.
- UI changes in web/ require visual verification via Playwright MCP screenshot
  - Reason: Tests passing does not guarantee UI renders correctly. Visual evidence ensures feature works as intended.

### Failed Attempts (DO NOT repeat)
- debugging Insufficient Balance error when orch usage showed 99% remaining

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.





📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚡ LIGHT TIER: SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required for this spawn.



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation test-docker-kb-bd-fixed` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-test-docker-kb-bd-fixed.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. ⚡ SYNTHESIS.md is NOT required (light tier spawn).


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input



## SKILL GUIDANCE (hello)

**IMPORTANT:** You have been spawned WITH this skill context already loaded.
You do NOT need to invoke this skill using the Skill tool.
Simply follow the guidance provided below.

---

---
name: hello
skill-type: procedure
audience: worker
spawnable: true
category: test
description: Simple test skill that prints hello and exits
allowed-tools:
- Bash
deliverables: []
verification:
  requirements: |
    - [ ] Agent printed "Hello from orch-go!"
  test_command: null
  required: true
---

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.
