## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "orchestrator"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- orch-go DefaultModel should be Opus (claude-opus-4-5-20251101), not Gemini
  - Reason: Orchestrator guidance expects Opus for complex work, current Gemini default conflicts with operational practice
- Worker spawns must set ORCH_WORKER=1 to skip orchestrator skill loading
  - Reason: Orchestrator skill (1,251 lines ~37k tokens) is auto-loaded by session-context plugin for all orch projects but is unnecessary for worker sessions, wastes context budget
- LLM guidance compliance requires signal balance - overwhelming counter-patterns (56:13 ratio) drowns specific exceptions
  - Reason: Investigation found orchestrator skill has 4:1 ask-vs-act signal ratio causing autonomy guidance to fail
- Dashboard must be fully usable at 666px width (half MacBook Pro screen). No horizontal scrolling. All critical info visible without scrolling.
  - Reason: Primary workflow is orchestrator CLI + dashboard side-by-side on MacBook Pro. Minimum width constraint - should expand gracefully on larger displays.
- Orchestrator is AI, not Dylan - Dylan interacts with AI orchestrators who spawn/complete agents
  - Reason: Investigation 2025-12-25-design-orchestrator-completion-lifecycle-two incorrectly framed Dylan as the actor who spawns agents. The actor model is: Dylan ↔ AI Orchestrator ↔ Worker Agents. Mental model sync flows: Agent→Orchestrator (synthesis) and Orchestrator→Dylan (conversation).
- sync-workers-session.sh tmux hook disabled for single-window setup
  - Reason: Hook causes unwanted session switches when only one Ghostty window is open. Re-enable in ~/.tmux.conf.local when using dual-window orchestrator/workers setup.
- Dylan doesn't interact with dashboard directly - orchestrator uses Glass for all browser interactions
  - Reason: Pressure Over Compensation: forces gaps in Glass tooling to surface rather than routing around them
- Worker spawns must set ORCH_WORKER=1 to skip orchestrator skill loading
  - Reason: Orchestrator skill (1,251 lines ~37k tokens) is auto-loaded by session-context plugin for all orch projects but is unnecessary for worker sessions, wastes context budget
- cross project agent visibility requires fetching beads comments from agent's project directory, not orchestrator's current directory
  - Reason: Agents spawned with --workdir run in different repos than orchestrator. bd comments uses cwd by default, missing the agent's actual beads issue.
- Dashboard must be fully usable at 666px width (half MacBook Pro screen). No horizontal scrolling. All critical info visible without scrolling.
  - Reason: Primary workflow is orchestrator CLI + dashboard side-by-side on MacBook Pro. Minimum width constraint - should expand gracefully on larger displays.
- LLM guidance compliance requires signal balance - overwhelming counter-patterns (56:13 ratio) drowns specific exceptions
  - Reason: Investigation found orchestrator skill has 4:1 ask-vs-act signal ratio causing autonomy guidance to fail
- Orchestrator is AI, not Dylan - Dylan interacts with AI orchestrators who spawn/complete agents
  - Reason: Investigation 2025-12-25-design-orchestrator-completion-lifecycle-two incorrectly framed Dylan as the actor who spawns agents. The actor model is: Dylan ↔ AI Orchestrator ↔ Worker Agents. Mental model sync flows: Agent→Orchestrator (synthesis) and Orchestrator→Dylan (conversation).
- orch-go DefaultModel should be Opus (claude-opus-4-5-20251101), not Gemini
  - Reason: Orchestrator guidance expects Opus for complex work, current Gemini default conflicts with operational practice
- Orchestrator skill edits must be made to .skillc/SKILL.md.template then rebuilt with skillc build
  - Reason: SKILL.md is auto-generated; direct edits to deployed file will be overwritten on next build
- cross project agent visibility requires fetching beads comments from agent's project directory, not orchestrator's current directory
  - Reason: Agents spawned with --workdir run in different repos than orchestrator. bd comments uses cwd by default, missing the agent's actual beads issue.

### Prior Decisions
- Orchestrator sessions need SESSION_HANDOFF.md
  - Reason: Session amnesia applies to orchestrator work; skillc pattern provides mature template
- Session boundaries have three distinct patterns: worker (protocol-driven via Phase:Complete), orchestrator (state-driven via session-transition), and cross-session (manual via SESSION_HANDOFF.md)
  - Reason: Investigation found no unified boundary protocol; each type optimized for its context
- Reflection value comes from orchestrator review + follow-up, not execution-time process changes
  - Reason: Evidence: post-synthesis reflection with Dylan created orch-go-ws4z epic (6 children) from captured questions
- Tiered spawn protocol uses .tier file in workspace for orch complete
  - Reason: Allows VerifyCompletion to read tier from workspace and skip SYNTHESIS.md requirement for light-tier spawns without requiring orchestrator to pass tier explicitly
- Default spawn mode is headless with --tmux opt-in
  - Reason: Aligns implementation with documentation (CLAUDE.md, orchestrator skill), reduces TUI overhead for automation, tmux still available via explicit flag
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.
- After agents commit Go changes, orchestrator should auto-rebuild and restart affected services
  - Reason: Manual rebuild/restart is friction. Pattern: detect changed files (cmd/orch/, pkg/) → make install → restart orch serve if running. Could be hook or part of orch complete flow.
- Orchestrator sessions should transition at 75-80% context usage
  - Reason: At 78% (156k tokens), quality still good but approaching risk zone. Below 75% continue freely, above 85% responses may degrade. Use session-transition skill to capture state and create handoff.
- After agents commit Go changes, orchestrator should auto-rebuild and restart affected services
  - Reason: Manual rebuild/restart is friction. Pattern: detect changed files (cmd/orch/, pkg/) -> make install -> restart orch serve if running. Could be hook or part of orch complete flow.
- Usage progress bars show reset times inline with percentage
  - Reason: Reset time context is essential for orchestrator to know when to switch accounts or wait
- Pre-spawn context gathering (<5 min, for spawn prompts) is distinct from deep investigation (>15 min, delegate)
  - Reason: Orchestrator skill conflated these; explicit boundary resolves contradiction. See .kb/investigations/2025-12-25-inv-orchestrator-pre-spawn-context-gathering.md
- Daemon-first for batch work
  - Reason: Label issues triage:ready + skill:X, daemon auto-spawns. Orchestrator focuses on triage, labeling, synthesis, completion review. Manual orch spawn for single urgent items only.
- Pre-create SESSION_HANDOFF.md for orchestrator spawns
  - Reason: Encourages progressive documentation - orchestrators fill sections AS THEY WORK rather than reconstructing at end. Previously only template was copied, orchestrators had to manually create file.
- Principles Quick Reference added to orchestrator skill
  - Reason: Operationalizes 10/21 principles with quick-scan table format
- meta-orchestrator spawns use META_ORCHESTRATOR_CONTEXT.md with interactive framing
  - Reason: Task-completion framing (Session Goal, work toward goal) causes level collapse. Interactive framing (stay available, no handoff requirement) preserves meta-orchestrator behavior.
- Orchestrators don't need beads tracking
  - Reason: Orchestrators are interactive sessions with Dylan, not autonomous tasks. They use SESSION_HANDOFF.md as completion signal instead of Phase: Complete comments. Beads is for work that needs async discovery/tracking - orchestrators don't need that since Dylan is right there.
- orch patterns command surfaces behavioral patterns for orchestrator awareness
  - Reason: Command helps avoid blind respawning by detecting retry, persistent_failure, empty_context, recurring_gap, and futile_action patterns
- Add session resume protocol as standalone section after Session Reflection in orchestrator skill
  - Reason: Creates logical workflow progression (session end → handoff → resume) and makes documentation discoverable at the right point; alternative of expanding Focus-Based Session Model would bury operational details in design concept
- Meta-orchestrator is Dylan's role, documented in orchestrator skill section, not separate skill file
  - Reason: Meta-orchestrator is human role (strategic decisions), not agent skill; skill file implies automation that isn't appropriate
- orchestrator completion uses workspace name + SESSION_HANDOFF.md
  - Reason: Orchestrators skip beads tracking entirely, so they need an alternative completion signal

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference investigations for prior findings.





🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-u3byn "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment orch-go-u3byn "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-u3byn "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation add-orchestrator-skill-decision-tree` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-add-orchestrator-skill-decision-tree.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

   - **IMPORTANT:** After running `kb create`, report the actual path via:
     `bd comment orch-go-u3byn "investigation_path: /path/to/file.md"`
     (This allows orch complete to verify the correct file)

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-feat-add-orchestrator-skill-13jan-9876/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input


## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-u3byn**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-u3byn "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-u3byn "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-u3byn "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-u3byn "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-u3byn "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-u3byn`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

## Summary

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

---

# Feature Implementation (Unified Framework)

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

**For workers:** You've been spawned to implement a feature using a phased approach with specific configuration.

---

## Your Configuration

**Read from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md** to understand your configuration:

- **Phases:** Which phases you'll proceed through (e.g., `investigation,clarifying-questions,design,implementation,validation`)
- **Current Phase:** Determined by your progress (start with first configured phase)
- **Implementation Mode:** `tdd` or `direct` (only relevant if implementation phase included)
- **Validation Level:** `none`, `tests`, `smoke-test`, or `multi-phase` (only relevant if validation phase included)

**Example configuration:**
```
Phases: design, implementation, validation
Mode: tdd
Validation: smoke-test
```

---

## Deliverables

| Configuration | Required |
|---------------|----------|
| investigation phase | Investigation file |
| design phase | Design document |
| implementation phase | Source code |
| mode=tdd | Tests (write first) |
| validation=tests | Tests |
| validation=smoke-test | Validation evidence via bd comment |
| validation=multi-phase | Phase checkpoints via bd comment |

---

## Workflow

Proceed through phases sequentially per your configuration.

**Phases:** Investigation → Clarifying Questions → Design → Implementation (TDD/direct) → Validation → Self-Review → Integration

Track progress via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: X - details"`.

---

## Step 0: Scope Enumeration (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Prevent "Section Blindness" - implementing only part of spawn context.

**Before starting ANY phase work:**

1. **Read ENTIRE SPAWN_CONTEXT** - Don't skim. Don't stop at first section.
2. **Enumerate ALL Requirements** - List every deliverable from ALL sections
3. **Report Scope via Beads:**
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Scope: 1. [requirement] 2. [requirement] 3. [requirement] ..."
   ```
4. **Flag Uncertainty** - If unclear what's in scope, ask before proceeding

**Why:** Agents repeatedly implement `## Implementation` while ignoring other sections. Forcing explicit enumeration catches this BEFORE implementation.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Read full SPAWN_CONTEXT (all sections)
- [ ] Enumerated ALL requirements
- [ ] Reported scope via `bd comment`
- [ ] Flagged any uncertainty

**Once Step 0 complete → Proceed to first configured phase.**

---

## Phase Guidance

### Investigation Phase

**Purpose:** Understand existing system before making changes.

**Deliverables:**
- Investigation file: `.kb/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-inv-{topic}.md`
- Findings with Evidence-Source-Significance pattern
- Synthesis connecting findings

**Key workflow:**
1. Create investigation template BEFORE exploring (not at end)
2. Add findings progressively as you explore
3. Update synthesis every 3-5 findings
4. Document uncertainty honestly (tested vs untested)

**Completion:** Investigation committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Clarifying Questions"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-investigation.md` for detailed workflow, templates, and examples.

---

### Clarifying Questions Phase

**Purpose:** Surface ambiguities BEFORE design work begins.

**Deliverables:**
- Questions documented via `bd comment`
- Answers received from orchestrator
- No remaining ambiguities

**Key workflow:**
1. Review what you know (investigation findings or SPAWN_CONTEXT)
2. Identify gaps: Edge cases? Error handling? Integration? Compatibility? Security?
3. Ask using directive-guidance pattern (state recommendation, ask if matches intent)
4. Block until answers received

**Completion:** All questions answered, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-clarifying-questions.md` for question categories and patterns.

---

### Design Phase

**Purpose:** Document architectural approach before implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- Design document: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}.md`
- Testing strategy
- Architecture decision with trade-off analysis

**Key workflow:**
1. Review investigation findings (if applicable)
2. Determine if design exploration needed (multiple viable approaches → escalate)
3. Create design document using template
4. Get orchestrator approval before implementation

**Completion:** Design approved, committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Implementation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-design.md` for detailed workflow and template.

---

### Implementation Phase (TDD Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement feature using test-driven development.

**When to use:** Feature adds/changes behavior (APIs, business logic, UI).

**The Iron Law:** NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Explore codebase with Task tool before coding
2. **TDD Cycle:** RED (write failing test) → GREEN (minimal code to pass) → REFACTOR
3. **UI features:** Mandatory smoke test (tests passing ≠ feature working)
4. **Commit pattern:** Separate test and implementation commits

**Red flags (STOP and restart):**
- Writing code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Rationalizing "just this once"

**Completion:** All tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-tdd.md` and `reference/tdd-best-practices.md`.

---

### Implementation Phase (Direct Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement non-behavioral changes without TDD overhead.

**When to use:** Refactoring, configuration, documentation, code cleanup.

⚠️ **Critical:** If changing behavior → STOP and switch to TDD mode.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Verify change is non-behavioral
2. Run existing tests (establish baseline)
3. Make focused changes (≤2 files, ≤1 hour)
4. Verify no regressions

**Completion:** Tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-direct.md`.

---

### Validation Phase

**Purpose:** Verify implementation works as intended.

**Validation levels:**

| Level | Workflow |
|-------|----------|
| `none` | Commit, report complete |
| `tests` | Run test suite, verify pass, commit |
| `smoke-test` | Tests + manual verification + evidence capture |
| `multi-phase` | Tests + smoke + STOP for orchestrator approval |

**⚠️ UI Visual Verification (MANDATORY if web/ files modified):**

Before completing, run: `git diff --name-only | grep "^web/"`

If ANY files returned → Visual verification is REQUIRED:
1. Rebuild server: `make install` then restart via `orch servers`
2. Capture screenshot via Playwright MCP (`browser_take_screenshot` tool)
3. Document evidence: `bd comment <beads-id> "Visual verification: [description]"`

**⛔ Cannot mark Phase: Complete without visual evidence for web/ changes.**

**When validation fails:**
1. Check logs for runtime errors (test output, project logs)
2. Analyze failure output
3. Return to Implementation, fix, re-validate

**Completion:** Validation evidence documented, reported via `bd comment`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-validation.md` and `reference/validation-examples.md`.

---

### Integration Phase

**Purpose:** Combine multiple validated phases into cohesive feature.

**When to use:** Multi-phase features after individual phases validated.

**Key workflow:**
1. Review all completed phases via beads history
2. Identify integration points (data flow, shared state, API contracts)
3. Write integration tests for cross-phase scenarios
4. E2E verification + regression testing
5. Final smoke test of complete feature

**Completion:** Integration tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-integration.md`.

---

## Self-Review Phase (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Quality gate before completion.

**Perform these checks before marking complete:**

### Original Symptom Validation (For Bug Fixes)
- [ ] Re-ran the EXACT command/scenario from original issue (same flags, same mode)
- [ ] Documented actual result (not an estimate) via `bd comment`
- [ ] If testing different mode/flag than original, explicitly justified why

**⚠️ Scope Redefinition Warning:** Agents can claim "fix complete" by testing a different scenario (e.g., `--json` flag when issue showed bare command). The fix is only verified when the original failing scenario passes.

### Anti-Pattern Detection
- [ ] No god objects (files >300 lines or multiple concerns)
- [ ] No tight coupling (use dependency injection)
- [ ] No magic values (use named constants)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>3 levels → extract to helpers)
- [ ] No incomplete work (TODOs, placeholders)

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal)

### Commit Hygiene
- [ ] Conventional format: `type: description`
- [ ] Atomic commits (one logical change each)
- [ ] No WIP commits

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements

### Deliverables
- [ ] All required deliverables exist and complete
- [ ] Deliverables reported via `bd comment`

### Integration Wiring (CRITICAL)
- [ ] New modules imported somewhere
- [ ] New functions called somewhere
- [ ] New routes registered
- [ ] New components rendered
- [ ] No orphaned code

### Demo Data Ban (CRITICAL)
- [ ] No fake identities in production code
- [ ] No placeholder domains (use env vars)
- [ ] No lorem ipsum or magic numbers as data

### Scope Verification (For refactoring/migration)
- [ ] Ran `rg "old_pattern"` - should return 0
- [ ] Ran `rg "new_pattern"` - should match expected count

### Discovered Work
- [ ] Reviewed for discoveries (bugs, tech debt, enhancement ideas)
- [ ] Created beads issues with `triage:review` label (default - lets orchestrator review before daemon spawns)

### Original Symptom Validation (For Bug Fixes)

⚠️ **This gate is MANDATORY for bug fixes.** Skip only for pure features/refactoring.

**Purpose:** Prevent "scope redefinition" - fixing a different problem than the original symptom.

**Before marking complete:**
1. **Re-run the original failing command** from the issue
   - Not a similar command - the EXACT command (same flags, same mode)
   - Example: If issue shows `time orch status # 1:25.67`, run `time orch status` (not `time orch status --json`)
2. **Document the actual result** in a beads comment:
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Original symptom validation: [command] → [result]"
   ```
3. **Compare against original evidence** - is the symptom resolved?

**⚠️ Scope Redefinition Warning:**
If your fix validates against a DIFFERENT command/mode than the original issue:
- Example: Original issue shows text mode slow, you're testing JSON mode
- Example: Original issue shows `--verbose` flag, you're testing without it

This is a RED FLAG. Either:
- Re-test with the original command and document result
- OR explicitly justify why the different command is a valid proxy (with beads comment)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Re-ran exact original command from issue
- [ ] Documented actual timing/behavior via `bd comment`
- [ ] Result matches expected fix (not an estimate like "~10s")
- [ ] If testing different mode/flags: justified why via `bd comment`

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**If validation skipped:** Document why in completion comment (e.g., "Original symptom validation: N/A - pure refactoring, no bug fix")

**Reference:** `.kb/investigations/2025-12-29-inv-root-cause-analysis-agent-orch.md` - Root cause analysis showing why this gate matters.

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**When passed:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"`

## Leave it Better (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Every session should externalize what you learned.

**Before marking complete, run at least one:**

| What You Learned | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| Made a choice | `kb quick decide "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Something failed | `kb quick tried "X" --failed "Y"` |
| Found a constraint | `kb quick constrain "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Open question | `kb quick question "X"` |

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflected on what was learned
- [ ] Ran at least one `kb quick` command OR noted why nothing to externalize
- [ ] Included "Leave it Better" status in completion comment

---

## Phase Transitions

**After completing each phase:**
1. Report progress: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: <new-phase> - <brief summary>"`
2. Output: "Phase complete, moving to next phase"
3. Continue to next phase guidance

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Step 0 completed (scope enumerated)
- [ ] All configured phases completed
- [ ] Self-review passed
- [ ] Leave it Better completed
- [ ] All deliverables created
- [ ] All changes committed: `git status` shows "nothing to commit"
- [ ] **If web/ modified:** Visual verification completed with `bd comment` evidence
- [ ] Final status: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [summary]"`

**⚠️ If web/ files modified without visual verification → completion will be REJECTED.**

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

**Final step:** After all criteria met:
1. `bd close <beads-id> --reason "summary"`
2. Call /exit to close agent session

---

## Troubleshooting

**Stuck:** Re-read phase guidance, check SPAWN_CONTEXT. If blocked: `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`

**Unclear requirements:** `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"` and wait

**Scope changes:** Document change, ask orchestrator via beads comment
