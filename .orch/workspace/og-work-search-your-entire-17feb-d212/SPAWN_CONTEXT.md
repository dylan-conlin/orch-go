SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "search your entire"

### Prior Decisions
- kb search and rg are complementary tools
  - Reason: kb searches knowledge artifacts (.kb/), rg searches code - agents should use both strategically based on query type

- macOS Click Freeze
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/macos-click-freeze.md
  - Summary:
    Trackpad clicks stop registering while cursor movement and keyboard continue working. `sudo killall -HUP WindowServer` fixes it every time (HUP = reconfigure, not restart). This points to WindowServer accumulating corrupted state in its click event pipeline. **Breakthrough in Session 15:** nuclear elimination of ~23 services stopped the freeze. **Freeze returned (2026-02-13)** after gradual service re-enablement — first recurrence in ~2 days. **However (2026-02-14):** the same service set that triggered the Feb 13 freeze ran stable for 5+ hours, suggesting the freeze is **intermittent/stochastic** rather than deterministic. Frequency has decreased from every ~15 min (Sessions 11-14) to rare occurrences. macOS updated to 15.7.4 (from 15.6.1) between sessions. **H6 (aggregate service contention) remains the leading hypothesis** but is weakened by the stability observation. **New approach:** reactive capture script (`scripts/click-freeze-capture.sh`) to snapshot full system state during freeze occurrences for correlation analysis, rather than disruptive elimination testing.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Hypothesis 1: yabai event interception corrupts WindowServer state — WEAKENED (RE-TESTING NEEDED)
    
    yabai uses the macOS Accessibility API to manage windows. Freeze recurred with yabai fully stopped in Session 14 (`yabai --stop-service`, confirmed no process via `pgrep`).
    
    **Evidence against:** Freeze recurred within ~30 minutes with yabai completely stopped (Session 14). No yabai process running. Seemed eliminated.
    
    **Evidence for re-testing (Session 16):** The Session 14 elimination was a single 30-min test with everything else still running. The environment is now different — yabai is running with a reduced service set (NI/Ollama gone, many agents disabled). yabai may not be the sole cause but could be a necessary component of H6 (aggregate contention). Worth re-testing by stopping yabai in current environment.
    
    ### Hypothesis 2: Karabiner DriverKit drops click events at kernel level — ELIMINATED
    
    Karabiner was fully uninstalled (app removed, DriverKit extension gone, no IOKit registry entries, no LaunchAgents). Freeze persisted immediately after fresh reboot with no Karabiner components present.
    
    **Evidence against:** Completely uninstalled — no process, no DriverKit extension (`systemextensionsctl list` clean), no IOKit entries (`ioreg` clean), no LaunchAgents. Freeze still occurred immediately post-reboot. Definitively eliminated.
    
    ### Hypothesis 3: WindowServer internal corruption (no external cause) — WEAKENED
    
    macOS 15.6.1 (Sequoia) may have a bug where WindowServer's click event routing table gets corrupted over time. This would be independent of any third-party software.
    
    **Evidence for:** Would explain why eliminating multiple apps in Session 11 didn't fix it.
    
    **Evidence against:** Three research probes (2026-02-11) searched GitHub, Reddit, Apple Discussions exhaustively — **zero matching reports** for this symptom pattern (clicks stop, cursor moves, HUP fixes). If this were a Sequoia bug, community reports would exist. This significantly weakens H3.
    
    ### Hypothesis 4: Memory pressure from OpenCode instance accumulation — EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED
    
    OpenCode accumulates instances (with LSP/MCP/file watchers) per unique project directory. Each instance costs 300-500MB for LSP alone.
    
    **Evidence against (Session 15):**
    - Freeze occurred **immediately after fresh reboot** — memory was abundant, OpenCode hadn't even started yet
    - This strongly suggests memory pressure is NOT the primary cause
    - After disabling ~23 services,

- Completion Verification Architecture
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/completion-verification.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-14.
    Changed files: pkg/verify/check.go, pkg/verify/visual.go, .beads/issues.jsonl.
    Deleted files: pkg/verify/phase.go, pkg/verify/evidence.go, cmd/orch/complete.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Completion verification operates through **three independent gates** (Phase, Evidence, Approval) that check different aspects of "done". Phase gate verifies agent claims completion, Evidence gate requires visual/test proof in beads comments, Approval gate (UI changes only) requires human sign-off. Verification is **tier-aware**: light tier checks Phase + commits, full tier adds SYNTHESIS.md, orchestrator tier checks SESSION_HANDOFF.md instead. The **5-tier escalation model** surfaces knowledge-producing work (investigation/architect/research) for mandatory orchestrator review before auto-closing. Cross-project detection uses SPAWN_CONTEXT.md to determine which directory to verify in. **Targeted bypasses** (`--skip-{gate} "reason"`) replace blanket `--force`, allowing specific gates to be skipped while others still run.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Evidence Gate False Positive
    
    
    **What happens:** Agent passes Evidence gate without actual visual verification.
    
    **Root cause:** Agent generates screenshot placeholder text ("Screenshot attached") without actually attaching screenshot. Evidence gate searches for keyword "screenshot", finds it, passes.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Text-based keyword matching can't distinguish placeholder from actual proof.
    
    **Fix:** Approval gate for UI changes. Even if Evidence passes, human must verify via --approve.
    
    **Why this matters:** False positive on Evidence gate means broken UI ships thinking it's verified.
    
    ### 2. Approval Gate Bypass
    
    **What happens:** Non-UI changes accidentally avoid approval gate.
    
    **Root cause:** File path detection (`modifiedWebFiles()`) misclassifies files. `web-utils/` not under `web/`, approval skipped.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** File structure varies across projects. Heuristics (path contains "web") can miss edge cases.
    
    **Fix:** Explicit skill-based detection. `feature-impl` with UI flag requires approval, regardless of file paths.
    
    **Future:** Skill manifest declares "requires_ui_approval: true".
    
    ### 3. Cross-Project Verification Wrong Directory
    
    **What happens:** Verification runs in wrong directory, checks wrong tests, reports false failure.
    
    **Root cause:** `SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` missing PROJECT_DIR, fallback uses workspace location (orch-go), but agent worked in orch-cli.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Workspace location != work location. No guaranteed signal of where work happened.
    
    **Fix:** `orch spawn --workdir` explicitly sets PROJECT_DIR in SPAWN_CONTEXT.md. Verification reads it.
    
    **Prevention:** Make --workdir mandatory for cross-project spawns, fail spawn if missing.

- Coaching Plugin
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/coaching-plugin.md
  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-02-14 (worker detection fix verified).
    Changed files: plugins/coaching.ts, pkg/opencode/client.go.
    Deleted files: ~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The Coaching Plugin is an OpenCode plugin that provides real-time behavioral feedback to orchestrators and workers through tool usage pattern detection. It implements the "Pain as Signal" architectural pattern: agents should feel friction in real-time rather than learning about it post-hoc.
    
    The plugin hooks `tool.execute.after` to observe tool usage patterns (it cannot see LLM response text—fundamental constraint), detects 8 behavioral patterns using behavioral proxies (action ratio, analysis paralysis, frame collapse, etc.), and injects coaching messages via `client.session.prompt({ noReply: true })`. Metrics persist to `~/.orch/coaching-metrics.jsonl` and are exposed via `/api/coaching` for dashboard visualization.
    
    **Current status (Feb 2026):** Both orchestrator and worker coaching operational. Orchestrator coaching: 1000+ metrics collected. Worker health tracking: verified working Feb 14 — stress test (50+ tool calls) emitted `context_usage` worker metric with zero orchestrator metric leakage. Fix required two opencode fork commits (459a1bfba, 0922edfe7) to: (1) read `x-opencode-env-ORCH_WORKER` header and set `session.metadata.role='worker'`, (2) pass `session.metadata` through `tool.execute.after` plugin hooks. **Note:** Worker detection only works for headless (OpenCode HTTP API) spawns — Claude CLI/tmux spawns bypass the HTTP session creation endpoint and don't get metadata set.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Plugins cannot see LLM response text** - Only tool calls visible, not free-text responses. Fundamental constraint, not fixable.
    2. **Behavioral proxies are the only detection mechanism** - All pattern detection uses tool usage as proxy signals.
    3. **Metrics persist, session state doesn't** - JSONL file survives restarts, in-memory Map is ephemeral.
    4. **Observation coupled to intervention** - Injection only fires from `flushMetrics` within `tool.execute.after` hook.
    5. **Worker detection caching is one-way** - Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`.
    6. **Two injection mechanisms serve different purposes** - `config.instructions` adds file references at config time (static context like skills), `client.session.prompt(noReply: true)` injects content at runtime (immediate coaching).
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Worker Detection Caching Bug (Jan 10-17)
    
    **Symptom:** Zero worker health metrics in production despite implemented code
    
    **Root cause:** `detectWorkerSession()` cached both `true` AND `false` results, permanently misclassifying workers if ANY tool call happened before a worker-identifying signal
    
    **Why it happens:**
    1. Worker session starts, first tool = `glob` (no detection signal)
    2. `isWorker = false` → cached → function returns `false` forever
    3. Second tool = `read SPAWN_CONTEXT.md` → cached result returned, detection skipped
    4. Worker treated as orchestrator for entire session
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    First non-matching tool call → cache false → subsequent detection signals ignored → worker health code never runs
    ```
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Only cache `true` results (confirmed worker), never cache `false`. Allow re-evaluation on each tool call until worker confirmed.
    
    **Pattern established:** "Never cache negative results in per-session detection"
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Invalid Detection Signal (Bash workdir)
    
    **Symptom:** Detection code exists but never fires
    
    **Root cause:** Detection checked for `args.workdir` on bash tool, but bash tool has no `workdir` argument
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Bash tool args are: `command`, `timeout`, `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`, `run_in_background`
    - No `workdir` argument exists
    - Detection signal `if (tool === "bash" && args?.workdir)` never matches
    
    **Fix (Jan 17):** Removed broken detection signal, restored file-path detection for any `.orch/workspace/` path
    
    ---
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Observation Coupled to Intervention (Restart Brittleness)
    
    **Symptom:** Coaching messages stop after OpenCode server restart, even though metrics show problems
    
    **Root cause:** Injection is implemented as side effect of metric collection, not as separate concern that can operate independently
    
    **Why it happens:**
    - Metrics are **persistent** (JSONL file, survive restart)
    - Session state is **in-memory** (Map, lost on restart)
    - Injection logic **coupled to metric collection** (only happens via `flushMetrics`)
    - After restart: metrics file shows "poor" status, but no session state exists, so injection never fires
    
    **Cascade:**
    ```
    Server restart → session state lost → flushMetrics not called → injection doesn't fire → coaching stops
    ```
    
    **Architectural fix (not yet implemented):** Separate injection into independent daemon that reads metrics from JSONL and injects via OpenCode API, completely decoupled

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-search-your-entire-17feb-d212/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.




## SKILL GUIDANCE (hello)

**IMPORTANT:** You have been spawned WITH this skill context already loaded.
You do NOT need to invoke this skill using the Skill tool.
Simply follow the guidance provided below.

---

---
name: hello
skill-type: procedure
audience: worker
spawnable: true
category: test
description: Simple test skill that prints hello and exits
allowed-tools:
- Bash
deliverables: []
verification:
  requirements: |
    - [ ] Agent printed "Hello from orch-go!"
  test_command: null
  required: true
---

# Hello Skill

**Purpose:** Test the spawn system with a trivial task.

## Directive

When spawned with this skill, print the following message exactly:

```
Hello from orch-go!
```

Then exit immediately by running `/exit`.

## Notes

- This is a minimal test skill to verify spawn functionality.
- No other actions are required.
- The verification is simply that the message was printed.
