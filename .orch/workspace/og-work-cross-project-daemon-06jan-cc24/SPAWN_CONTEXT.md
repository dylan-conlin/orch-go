TASK: Cross-project daemon - single daemon that polls all registered projects and spawns workers wherever work is ready. Current friction: daemon is project-scoped but work is cross-project, requiring multiple daemon instances.

SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "cross"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Beads cross-repo contamination can create orphaned FK references
  - Reason: bd-* prefixed dependencies were found in orch-go database from separate beads repo
- cross project agent visibility requires fetching beads comments from agent's project directory, not orchestrator's current directory
  - Reason: Agents spawned with --workdir run in different repos than orchestrator. bd comments uses cwd by default, missing the agent's actual beads issue.
- cross project agent visibility requires fetching beads comments from agent's project directory, not orchestrator's current directory
  - Reason: Agents spawned with --workdir run in different repos than orchestrator. bd comments uses cwd by default, missing the agent's actual beads issue.
- Always use Dylan's opencode fork at ~/Documents/personal/opencode, never npm-installed opencode-ai
  - Reason: Custom fixes (cross-project attach, etc.) only exist in fork. npm version shadows it and breaks features.

### Prior Decisions
- Headless Swarm = batch execution + rate-limit management across accounts
  - Reason: User clarified scope: focus on concurrent agent spawning with capacity management, not distributed architecture or multi-model routing
- Session boundaries have three distinct patterns: worker (protocol-driven via Phase:Complete), orchestrator (state-driven via session-transition), and cross-session (manual via SESSION_HANDOFF.md)
  - Reason: Investigation found no unified boundary protocol; each type optimized for its context
- D.E.K.N. is universal handoff structure
  - Reason: Delta/Evidence/Knowledge/Next enables 30-second context transfer between Claude instances - proven across SYNTHESIS.md, investigations, and session handoffs
- Cross-project epics use Option A: epic in primary repo, ad-hoc spawns with --no-track in secondary repos, manual bd close with commit refs
  - Reason: Only working pattern today. Beads multi-repo hydration is read-only aggregation, bd repo commands are buggy.
- Pre-spawn kb context should filter to orch ecosystem repos
  - Reason: 33% of global results are noise from unrelated repos (price-watch, dotfiles). Filtering preserves cross-repo signal while eliminating noise.
- When spawned for cross-repo work, verify work completion status before starting
  - Reason: Task orch-go-oo1f: spawned in orch-go for work in orch-knowledge. Template was already retired (commit 7430185) before agent fully engaged. Quick verification could have saved agent context.
- Use tmux-centric CLI commands for cross-project server management
  - Reason: Leverages existing port registry and tmuxinator infrastructure, fits developer workflow, delivers immediate value with minimal code (~200 lines)
- Cross-project agent visibility requires extracting PROJECT_DIR from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md
  - Reason: Beads comments are per-project; to show phase info for agents from other projects, must query the correct project's beads database
- Cross-project beads queries require PROJECT_DIR from workspace SPAWN_CONTEXT.md
  - Reason: Beads issues are per-project; bd commands run in current directory; for cross-project agent visibility, must extract PROJECT_DIR and query correct project's .beads/ directory
- Runtime dependency resolution is preferred over compile-time for cross-directory skill dependencies
  - Reason: skillc's graph validates dependencies exist within the same compilation context; cross-directory deps require orch-go's LoadSkillWithDependencies at spawn time
- orch abandon uses same --workdir pattern as spawn for cross-project operations
  - Reason: Consistency with spawn command; beads.DefaultDir enables socket discovery in target project
- Cross-project beads ID detection uses project prefix comparison
  - Reason: Consistent with abandon command pattern; extracts project from beads ID (e.g., kb-cli from kb-cli-xyz) and compares with current directory name
- orch complete auto-detects cross-project agents from workspace SPAWN_CONTEXT.md PROJECT_DIR
  - Reason: Follows same pattern as orch abandon --workdir; workspace metadata is authoritative source
- Skill changes route by blast radius + change type
  - Reason: Decision tree based on 60+ skill commits: infrastructure=design-session, local=direct, cross-skill depends on implicit dependencies
- Function extraction within package main requires no import changes
  - Reason: All files in cmd/orch share package main, Go handles cross-file visibility automatically
- registered projects included in orchestrator context
  - Reason: Orchestrators need cross-project awareness to spawn work without path hunting. kb projects list provides this data

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference investigations for prior findings.





🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-g7hax "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `bd comment orch-go-g7hax "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
3. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Surface it first: `bd comment orch-go-g7hax "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"`
2. Wait for orchestrator acknowledgment before proceeding
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation cross-project-daemon-single-daemon` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-cross-project-daemon-single-daemon.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

   - **IMPORTANT:** After running `kb create`, report the actual path via:
     `bd comment orch-go-g7hax "investigation_path: /path/to/file.md"`
     (This allows orch complete to verify the correct file)

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-cross-project-daemon-06jan-cc24/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input


## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-g7hax**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-g7hax "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-g7hax "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-g7hax "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-g7hax "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-g7hax "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-g7hax`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking

# Design Session Skill

**Purpose:** Transform vague ideas into actionable, well-scoped work through structured context gathering and collaborative discussion.

---

## When to Use

| Use design-session | Use architect | Use investigation |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "I want to add X" (vague scope) | "Should we do X?" (strategic choice) | "How does X work?" (understand existing) |
| Feature ideation | Trade-off analysis | Root cause analysis |
| Scope definition | System shaping | Codebase exploration |

**The key distinction:** Design-session is for *scoping work*, architect is for *strategic decisions*, investigation is for *understanding*.

---

## Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)
    ↓
Phase 2: Design Synthesis (Semi-Autonomous)
    ↓
Phase 3: Output Creation (Autonomous)
    ↓
One of: Epic | Investigation | Decision
```

---

## Phase 1: Context Gathering (Autonomous)

**Goal:** Understand existing context before discussing scope.

### 1.0 Review Foundational Principles

**Before scoping work, review:** `~/.kb/principles.md`

Key principles for design sessions:
- **Premise before solution** - Before scoping "how to do X", validate "should we do X?" Don't assume the request direction is correct
- **Evolve by distinction** - When scope is unclear, ask "what are we conflating?"
- **Evidence hierarchy** - Code is truth; artifacts are hypotheses to verify
- **Session amnesia** - Will this scoping help the next Claude resume?
- **Escalation is information flow** - When scope discussion reveals strategic uncertainty, escalate - you're routing information to someone who can see patterns you can't

Consider which principles apply when making scoping decisions.

### 1.1 Gather Knowledge Context

```bash
# Find relevant knowledge (constraints, decisions, investigations)
kb context "<topic keywords>"

# Example
kb context "rate limiting"
kb context "user authentication"
```

### 1.2 Gather Issue Context

```bash
# Find related beads issues
bd list --labels "<area>" 2>/dev/null | head -20
bd ready | grep -i "<keyword>" | head -10

# Find blocked work that might be related
bd blocked | grep -i "<keyword>" | head -10
```

### 1.3 Gather Codebase Context (If Applicable)

```bash
# Find relevant code areas
rg "<keyword>" --type-list  # See available types
rg "<pattern>" --type py -l | head -10

# Read key files
# Use Read tool for files identified above
```

### 1.4 Document Findings

Create a structured summary of what you found:

```markdown
## Context Gathered

### Existing Knowledge
- [kn entries found]
- [relevant investigations]
- [applicable decisions]

### Related Issues
- [existing issues on topic]
- [blocked items that relate]

### Codebase State
- [relevant files/modules]
- [existing implementations]
```

**Report:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Context Gathering - Found [N] related items"`

---

## Phase 2: Design Synthesis (Semi-Autonomous)

**Goal:** Present findings, refine scope through discussion, determine output type.

### 2.1 Present Context Summary

Present your findings naturally (not using AskUserQuestion yet):

```markdown
Here's what I found relevant to [topic]:

**Existing Knowledge:**
- [summary of constraints/decisions]

**Related Work:**
- [existing issues]
- [blocked items]

**Current State:**
- [what exists in codebase]

**Initial Questions:**
1. [clarifying question 1]
2. [clarifying question 2]
```

### 2.2 Refine Scope Through Discussion

**Question patterns for scoping:**

| Question Type | When to Ask | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Boundary** | Scope unclear | "Should this include X or is that separate?" |
| **Priority** | Multiple options | "Which of these is most important to start?" |
| **Constraint** | Trade-offs exist | "Are you optimizing for speed or completeness?" |
| **Dependency** | Order matters | "Does this need X first, or can they be parallel?" |

**Use natural conversation for discussion.** Reserve AskUserQuestion for:
- Forcing explicit choice between options
- When multiple rounds haven't converged

### 2.3 Determine Output Type

Based on discussion, assess clarity level:

| Clarity Level | Output Type | Indicators |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **High** | Epic with children | Clear scope, decomposable into tasks, no major unknowns |
| **Medium** | Investigation | Some unknowns remain, need exploration first |
| **Low** | Decision | Architectural choice blocks progress |

**Decision tree:**

```
Can we list the specific tasks needed?
├── YES → Do we understand all the tasks well enough to implement?
│   ├── YES → Epic with children
│   └── NO → Investigation (to clarify unknowns)
└── NO → Is this blocked by a strategic choice?
    ├── YES → Decision artifact
    └── NO → Investigation (to discover tasks)
```

**Report:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design Synthesis - Determined output: [type]"`

---

## Phase 3: Output Creation (Autonomous)

Based on the determined output type, follow the appropriate path.

---

### Path A: Epic with Children

**When:** Scope is clear, work decomposes into discrete tasks.

#### A.1 Create the Epic

```bash
bd create "Epic: [high-level goal]" \
  --type epic \
  --description "## Goal

[What this epic achieves]

## Scope

- [In scope item 1]
- [In scope item 2]

## Out of Scope

- [Explicitly excluded]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]"
```

#### A.2 Create Child Issues

For each discrete task:

```bash
bd create "[Task title]" \
  --type task \
  --parent <epic-id> \
  --description "## Context

Part of [epic-id]: [epic title]

## Task

[What needs to be done]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]"
```

#### A.3 Set Up Dependencies (If Needed)

```bash
# If task B depends on task A
bd dep add <task-b-id> --blocks <task-a-id>

# Common patterns:
# - Design → Implementation
# - Backend → Frontend
# - Core → Extensions
```

#### A.4 Apply Labels

```bash
# For all children
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready  # Ready for work
bd label <issue-id> area:auth     # Area label
```

**Reference: Beads Epic Patterns**

| Pattern | When to Use | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Sequential** | Tasks must be done in order | Design → Implement → Test |
| **Parallel** | Tasks can be done independently | Multiple unrelated features |
| **Diamond** | Multiple paths converge | Backend + Frontend → Integration |

---

### Path B: Investigation

**When:** Unknowns remain that need exploration before planning.

#### B.1 Create Investigation

```bash
kb create investigation design/<slug>
```

#### B.2 Document What's Known and Unknown

Fill the investigation template:

```markdown
# Design Investigation: [Topic]

**Date:** [today]
**Status:** Active

## Question

What do we need to understand before we can plan [topic]?

## What We Know

- [From context gathering]
- [From discussion]

## What We Need to Learn

1. [Unknown 1]
2. [Unknown 2]

## Proposed Exploration

- [ ] [Investigation step 1]
- [ ] [Investigation step 2]

## Next Steps

After this investigation, expect to produce:
- [ ] Epic with children (if unknowns resolved)
- [ ] Decision artifact (if choice needed)
```

#### B.3 Create Follow-Up Issue

```bash
bd create "Investigate: [topic] design unknowns" \
  --type task \
  --description "Investigation artifact: .kb/investigations/[date]-design-[slug].md

Complete the investigation, then create follow-up work based on findings."
```

---

### Path C: Decision

**When:** Architectural choice blocks progress.

#### C.1 Create Decision Artifact

```bash
kb create decision <slug>
```

#### C.2 Document the Choice Needed

Fill the decision template:

```markdown
# [Decision Title]

**Date:** [today]
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

[Why this decision is needed now]

## Question

[The specific architectural question]

## Options

### Option A: [Name]

**Description:** [How it works]
**Pros:** [Benefits]
**Cons:** [Drawbacks]

### Option B: [Name]

**Description:** [How it works]
**Pros:** [Benefits]
**Cons:** [Drawbacks]

## Recommendation

[If you have one, state it with reasoning]

## Decision

[Leave blank - Dylan decides]

## Consequences

[What changes based on the decision]
```

#### C.3 Create Decision Review Issue

```bash
bd create "Decision needed: [topic]" \
  --type task \
  --labels "triage:review" \
  --description "Decision artifact: .kb/decisions/[date]-[slug].md

Review and make the architectural choice before proceeding with implementation."
```

---

## Beads Mastery Reference

### Creating Epics with Children

```bash
# Step 1: Create epic
bd create "Epic: User authentication" --type epic --description "..."
# Returns: orch-abc123

# Step 2: Create children with parent reference
bd create "Design auth flow" --type task --parent orch-abc123
bd create "Implement login" --type task --parent orch-abc123
bd create "Add tests" --type task --parent orch-abc123
```

### Setting Up Dependencies

```bash
# Task B is blocked by Task A (A must finish first)
bd dep add <task-b> --blocks <task-a>

# Check dependency tree
bd dep tree <epic-id>

# Find issues blocked by something
bd blocked
```

### Labels for Triage

| Label | Meaning | When to Apply |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| `triage:ready` | Ready for work | Clear scope, no blockers |
| `triage:review` | Needs human review | Uncertainty, needs input |
| `area:*` | Component area | auth, ui, api, etc. |
| `skill:*` | Recommended skill | feature-impl, investigation, etc. |

```bash
# Apply labels
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready
bd label <issue-id> area:auth skill:feature-impl
```

### Epic Status Checking

```bash
# See epic completion status
bd epic status <epic-id>

# Close eligible epics (all children done)
bd epic close-eligible
```

---

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify:

### Phase Completion

| Phase | Check | If Failed |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Context Gathering** | Ran kb context and bd queries? | Run now |
| **Design Synthesis** | Discussed scope, determined output type? | Present findings |
| **Output Creation** | Produced appropriate artifact? | Complete output |

### Output Quality

#### For Epics:
- [ ] Epic has clear goal and scope
- [ ] Children are discrete, implementable tasks
- [ ] Dependencies set where needed
- [ ] Labels applied (triage:ready or triage:review)
- [ ] Each child has acceptance criteria

#### For Investigations:
- [ ] Question clearly stated
- [ ] Known/unknown clearly separated
- [ ] Next steps defined
- [ ] Follow-up issue created

#### For Decisions:
- [ ] Context explains why now
- [ ] Options clearly presented
- [ ] Pros/cons for each option
- [ ] Review issue created

## Leave it Better (Mandatory)

**Before marking complete, externalize at least one piece of knowledge:**

| What You Learned | Command | Example |
|------------------|---------|---------|
| Made a choice with reasoning | `kn decide` | `kn decide "Scope auth to session-based only" --reason "OAuth deferred to phase 2"` |
| Tried something that failed | `kn tried` | `kn tried "Single mega-epic" --failed "Too large, decomposed into 3 smaller epics"` |
| Discovered a constraint | `kn constrain` | `kn constrain "Must maintain backward compat" --reason "Existing API consumers"` |
| Found an open question | `kn question` | `kn question "Should notifications be real-time or polling?"` |

**Quick checklist:**
- [ ] Reflected on session: What did I learn that the next agent should know?
- [ ] Externalized at least one item via `kn` command

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment: "Leave it Better: Scope decisions captured in artifacts, no additional knowledge to externalize."

---

## Completion Criteria

Before marking complete:

- [ ] Phase 1: Context gathered (or skip-context used)
- [ ] Phase 2: Scope discussed, output type determined
- [ ] Phase 3: Appropriate artifact produced
- [ ] **Leave it Better completed** - At least one `kn` command run OR noted as not applicable
- [ ] All changes committed to git
- [ ] Report via beads: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - Created [output type]: [summary]"`
- [ ] Close beads issue: `bd close <beads-id> --reason "[summary]"`
- [ ] Call `/exit` to close agent session

---

## Related Skills

- **architect** - Use for strategic decisions with trade-off analysis
- **investigation** - Use when "how does X work?" (understand, not scope)
- **issue-creation** - Use for single issues from symptoms
- **feature-impl** - Use after design-session produces actionable epic/tasks

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Vague Feature Request
