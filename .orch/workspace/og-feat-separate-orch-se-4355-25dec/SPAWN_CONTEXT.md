TASK: Separate orch serve status from orch servers

🚨 CRITICAL - FIRST 3 ACTIONS:
You MUST do these within your first 3 tool calls:
1. Report via `bd comment orch-go-k0mg "Phase: Planning - [brief description]"`
2. Read relevant codebase context for your task
3. Begin planning

If Phase is not reported within first 3 actions, you will be flagged as unresponsive.
Do NOT skip this - the orchestrator monitors via beads comments.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL (READ NOW, DO AT END):
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:
1. Run: `bd comment orch-go-k0mg "Phase: Complete - [1-2 sentence summary of deliverables]"`
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session

⚠️ Work is NOT complete until Phase: Complete is reported.
⚠️ The orchestrator cannot close this issue until you report Phase: Complete.


CONTEXT: [See task description]

ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT:
- **Orchestration Pattern:** Per-project orchestrators (Architecture B)
  - Multiple `.orch/` directories across projects (meta-orchestration, price-watch, context-driven-dev, etc.)
  - Each project has independent orchestration context
  - Dylan switches contexts via `cd` - not managing all projects from one instance
  - When in `/project-name/`, you ARE that project's orchestrator
- **Key Architectural Constraints:**
  - Projects are architecturally independent (loose coupling)
  - Cross-project dependencies = exception, not rule
  - Shared concerns extracted to libraries, not coordinated via meta-orchestrator

⚠️ **META-ORCHESTRATION TEMPLATE SYSTEM** (Critical if working on meta-orchestration):

**IF task involves these files/patterns:**
- .orch/CLAUDE.md updates
- Orchestrator guidance changes
- Pattern/workflow documentation
- Any file with <!-- ORCH-TEMPLATE: ... --> markers

**THEN you MUST understand the template build system:**

**Template Architecture (3 layers):**
1. **Source:** templates-src/orchestrator/*.md ← EDIT HERE
2. **Distribution:** ~/.orch/templates/orchestrator/*.md (synced via `orch build-global`)
3. **Consumption:** .orch/CLAUDE.md (rebuilt via `orch build --orchestrator`)

**Critical Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER edit .orch/CLAUDE.md sections between `<!-- ORCH-TEMPLATE: ... -->` markers
- ✅ ALWAYS edit source in templates-src/orchestrator/
- ✅ ALWAYS rebuild: `orch build-global && orch build --orchestrator`

**Before editing ANY file:**
```bash
grep "ORCH-TEMPLATE\|Auto-generated" <file>
```

**If file has template markers:**
1. Find source template path in the Auto-generated comment
2. Edit templates-src/orchestrator/[template-name].md
3. Run: `orch build-global` (sync source → distribution)
4. Run: `orch build --orchestrator` (regenerate .orch/CLAUDE.md)
5. Verify changes appear in .orch/CLAUDE.md

**Files that are NOT templates (safe to edit directly):**
- docs/*.md
- tools/orch/*.py
- templates-src/ files (these ARE the source)

**Why this matters:**
- Changes to template-generated sections get SILENTLY OVERWRITTEN on next build
- This is a recurring amnesia bug (see post-mortem: .orch/knowledge/spawning-lessons/2025-11-20-forgot-template-system-context-recurring.md)

**Reference:** .orch/CLAUDE.md lines 77-125 for template system documentation

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

⛔ **NEVER spawn other agents.** Only orchestrators can spawn. If your task involves testing spawn functionality, simulate or mock it - do not actually spawn agents. Recursive spawning exhausts rate limits and creates chaos.

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **REPORT phase via beads:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Planning - [task description]"`
   - This is your primary progress tracking mechanism
   - Orchestrator monitors via `bd show <beads-id>`
3. **REPORT progress via beads:**
   - Use `bd comment <beads-id>` for phase transitions and milestones
   - Report blockers immediately: `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`
   - Report questions: `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"`
4. Report phase transitions via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: [phase] - [details]"`
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

STATUS UPDATES (CRITICAL):
Report phase transitions via `bd comment <beads-id>`:
- Phase: Planning
- Phase: Implementing
- Phase: Complete → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`
- `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"`

Orchestrator monitors via `bd show <beads-id>` (reads beads comments)

## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kn)

*Relevant knowledge discovered. CONSTRAINTS must be respected.*

```
DECISIONS (1):
  kn-be62db Tmux session existence is correct abstraction for 'orch servers' status - separate infrastructure from project servers
    reason: orch serve is persistent monitoring infrastructure, not ephemeral project server. Tmux lifecycle matches dev server lifecycle. Mixing them creates semantic confusion and false status reporting.
```

*If you discover new constraints, decisions, or failed approaches, record them:*
- `kn constrain "<rule>" --reason "<why>"`
- `kn decide "<what>" --reason "<why>"`
- `kn tried "<what>" --failed "<why>"`

## PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS (from kb)

*Relevant investigations and decisions discovered. Review for context.*

### Separate Orch Serve Status Orch
- **Path:** `.kb/investigations/2025-12-25-inv-separate-orch-serve-status-orch.md`
- **Type:** investigations
- **Relevant excerpts:**
  - _# Investigation: Separate Orch Serve Status Orch_

*If these investigations are relevant, read the full files for detailed context.*


## BEADS PROGRESS TRACKING (PREFERRED)

You were spawned from beads issue: **orch-go-k0mg**

**Use `bd comment` for progress updates instead of workspace-only tracking:**

```bash
# Report progress at phase transitions
bd comment orch-go-k0mg "Phase: Planning - Analyzing codebase structure"
bd comment orch-go-k0mg "Phase: Implementing - Adding authentication middleware"
bd comment orch-go-k0mg "Phase: Complete - All tests passing, ready for review"

# Report blockers immediately
bd comment orch-go-k0mg "BLOCKED: Need clarification on API contract"

# Report questions
bd comment orch-go-k0mg "QUESTION: Should we use JWT or session-based auth?"
```

**When to comment:**
- Phase transitions (Planning → Implementing → Testing → Complete)
- Significant milestones or findings
- Blockers or questions requiring orchestrator input
- Completion summary with deliverables

**Why beads comments:** Creates permanent, searchable progress history linked to the issue. Orchestrator can track progress across sessions via `bd show orch-go-k0mg`.

⛔ **NEVER run `bd close`** - Only the orchestrator closes issues via `orch complete`.
   - Workers report `Phase: Complete`, orchestrator verifies and closes
   - Running `bd close` bypasses verification and breaks tracking


## ADDITIONAL CONTEXT

BEADS ISSUE: orch-go-k0mg

Issue Description:
From architect investigation orch-go-lb61.

orch serve is infrastructure (global monitoring API), not a project server. Should not be in project port allocations.

**Implementation:**
1. Remove API server (port 3348) from project port registry
2. Add dedicated status command: `orch api status` or fold into `orch daemon status`
3. Show: running/stopped, port, uptime, connected clients

**Rationale:** orch servers = project dev infrastructure (tmux-managed, ephemeral). orch serve = orchestrator infrastructure (standalone, persistent). Different operational patterns.

See: .kb/investigations/2025-12-23-inv-design-question-should-orch-servers.md

## Summary

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

---

# Feature Implementation (Unified Framework)

**For orchestrators:** Spawn via `orch spawn feature-impl "task" --phases "..." --mode ... --validation ...`

**For workers:** You've been spawned to implement a feature using a phased approach with specific configuration.

---

## Your Configuration

**Read from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md** to understand your configuration:

- **Phases:** Which phases you'll proceed through (e.g., `investigation,clarifying-questions,design,implementation,validation`)
- **Current Phase:** Determined by your progress (start with first configured phase)
- **Implementation Mode:** `tdd` or `direct` (only relevant if implementation phase included)
- **Validation Level:** `none`, `tests`, `smoke-test`, or `multi-phase` (only relevant if validation phase included)

**Example configuration:**
```
Phases: design, implementation, validation
Mode: tdd
Validation: smoke-test
```

---

## Deliverables

| Configuration | Required |
|---------------|----------|
| investigation phase | Investigation file |
| design phase | Design document |
| implementation phase | Source code |
| mode=tdd | Tests (write first) |
| validation=tests | Tests |
| validation=smoke-test | Validation evidence via bd comment |
| validation=multi-phase | Phase checkpoints via bd comment |

---

## Workflow

Proceed through phases sequentially per your configuration.

**Phases:** Investigation → Clarifying Questions → Design → Implementation (TDD/direct) → Validation → Self-Review → Integration

Track progress via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: X - details"`.

---

## Step 0: Scope Enumeration (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Prevent "Section Blindness" - implementing only part of spawn context.

**Before starting ANY phase work:**

1. **Read ENTIRE SPAWN_CONTEXT** - Don't skim. Don't stop at first section.
2. **Enumerate ALL Requirements** - List every deliverable from ALL sections
3. **Report Scope via Beads:**
   ```bash
   bd comment <beads-id> "Scope: 1. [requirement] 2. [requirement] 3. [requirement] ..."
   ```
4. **Flag Uncertainty** - If unclear what's in scope, ask before proceeding

**Why:** Agents repeatedly implement `## Implementation` while ignoring other sections. Forcing explicit enumeration catches this BEFORE implementation.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Read full SPAWN_CONTEXT (all sections)
- [ ] Enumerated ALL requirements
- [ ] Reported scope via `bd comment`
- [ ] Flagged any uncertainty

**Once Step 0 complete → Proceed to first configured phase.**

---

## Phase Guidance

### Investigation Phase

**Purpose:** Understand existing system before making changes.

**Deliverables:**
- Investigation file: `.kb/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-inv-{topic}.md`
- Findings with Evidence-Source-Significance pattern
- Synthesis connecting findings

**Key workflow:**
1. Create investigation template BEFORE exploring (not at end)
2. Add findings progressively as you explore
3. Update synthesis every 3-5 findings
4. Document uncertainty honestly (tested vs untested)

**Completion:** Investigation committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Clarifying Questions"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-investigation.md` for detailed workflow, templates, and examples.

---

### Clarifying Questions Phase

**Purpose:** Surface ambiguities BEFORE design work begins.

**Deliverables:**
- Questions documented via `bd comment`
- Answers received from orchestrator
- No remaining ambiguities

**Key workflow:**
1. Review what you know (investigation findings or SPAWN_CONTEXT)
2. Identify gaps: Edge cases? Error handling? Integration? Compatibility? Security?
3. Ask using directive-guidance pattern (state recommendation, ask if matches intent)
4. Block until answers received

**Completion:** All questions answered, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Design"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-clarifying-questions.md` for question categories and patterns.

---

### Design Phase

**Purpose:** Document architectural approach before implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- Design document: `docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{feature}.md`
- Testing strategy
- Architecture decision with trade-off analysis

**Key workflow:**
1. Review investigation findings (if applicable)
2. Determine if design exploration needed (multiple viable approaches → escalate)
3. Create design document using template
4. Get orchestrator approval before implementation

**Completion:** Design approved, committed, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Implementation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-design.md` for detailed workflow and template.

---

### Implementation Phase (TDD Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement feature using test-driven development.

**When to use:** Feature adds/changes behavior (APIs, business logic, UI).

**The Iron Law:** NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Explore codebase with Task tool before coding
2. **TDD Cycle:** RED (write failing test) → GREEN (minimal code to pass) → REFACTOR
3. **UI features:** Mandatory smoke test (tests passing ≠ feature working)
4. **Commit pattern:** Separate test and implementation commits

**Red flags (STOP and restart):**
- Writing code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Rationalizing "just this once"

**Completion:** All tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-tdd.md` and `reference/tdd-best-practices.md`.

---

### Implementation Phase (Direct Mode)

**Purpose:** Implement non-behavioral changes without TDD overhead.

**When to use:** Refactoring, configuration, documentation, code cleanup.

⚠️ **Critical:** If changing behavior → STOP and switch to TDD mode.

**Key workflow:**
1. **Pre-impl exploration:** Verify change is non-behavioral
2. Run existing tests (establish baseline)
3. Make focused changes (≤2 files, ≤1 hour)
4. Verify no regressions

**Completion:** Tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-implementation-direct.md`.

---

### Validation Phase

**Purpose:** Verify implementation works as intended.

**Validation levels:**

| Level | Workflow |
|-------|----------|
| `none` | Commit, report complete |
| `tests` | Run test suite, verify pass, commit |
| `smoke-test` | Tests + manual verification + evidence capture |
| `multi-phase` | Tests + smoke + STOP for orchestrator approval |

**UI Visual Verification (REQUIRED if web/ files modified):**
1. Rebuild server: `make install` then restart via `orch servers`
2. Capture screenshot via Playwright MCP (`--mcp playwright`)
3. Include screenshot evidence in completion comment

**When validation fails:**
1. Check `agentlog errors` for runtime errors
2. Analyze failure output
3. Return to Implementation, fix, re-validate

**Completion:** Validation evidence documented, reported via `bd comment`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-validation.md` and `reference/validation-examples.md`.

---

### Integration Phase

**Purpose:** Combine multiple validated phases into cohesive feature.

**When to use:** Multi-phase features after individual phases validated.

**Key workflow:**
1. Review all completed phases via beads history
2. Identify integration points (data flow, shared state, API contracts)
3. Write integration tests for cross-phase scenarios
4. E2E verification + regression testing
5. Final smoke test of complete feature

**Completion:** Integration tests pass, reported via `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Validation"`

**Reference:** See `~/.claude/skills/worker/feature-impl/reference/phase-integration.md`.

---

## Self-Review Phase (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Quality gate before completion.

**Perform these checks before marking complete:**

### Anti-Pattern Detection
- [ ] No god objects (files >300 lines or multiple concerns)
- [ ] No tight coupling (use dependency injection)
- [ ] No magic values (use named constants)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>3 levels → extract to helpers)
- [ ] No incomplete work (TODOs, placeholders)

### Security Review
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] No injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command, path traversal)

### Commit Hygiene
- [ ] Conventional format: `type: description`
- [ ] Atomic commits (one logical change each)
- [ ] No WIP commits

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Happy path tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error paths tested

### Documentation
- [ ] Public APIs documented
- [ ] No commented-out code or debug statements

### Deliverables
- [ ] All required deliverables exist and complete
- [ ] Deliverables reported via `bd comment`

### Integration Wiring (CRITICAL)
- [ ] New modules imported somewhere
- [ ] New functions called somewhere
- [ ] New routes registered
- [ ] New components rendered
- [ ] No orphaned code

### Demo Data Ban (CRITICAL)
- [ ] No fake identities in production code
- [ ] No placeholder domains (use env vars)
- [ ] No lorem ipsum or magic numbers as data

### Scope Verification (For refactoring/migration)
- [ ] Ran `rg "old_pattern"` - should return 0
- [ ] Ran `rg "new_pattern"` - should match expected count

### Discovered Work
- [ ] Reviewed for discoveries (bugs, tech debt, enhancement ideas)
- [ ] Created beads issues with `triage:ready` or `triage:review` labels

**If issues found:** Fix immediately, commit, re-verify.

**When passed:** `bd comment <beads-id> "Self-review passed - ready for completion"`

---

## Leave it Better (REQUIRED)

**Purpose:** Every session should externalize what you learned.

**Before marking complete, run at least one:**

| What You Learned | Command |
|------------------|---------|
| Made a choice | `kn decide "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Something failed | `kn tried "X" --failed "Y"` |
| Found a constraint | `kn constrain "X" --reason "Y"` |
| Open question | `kn question "X"` |

**If nothing to externalize:** Note in completion comment.

**Completion Criteria:**
- [ ] Reflected on what was learned
- [ ] Ran at least one `kn` command OR noted why nothing to externalize
- [ ] Included "Leave it Better" status in completion comment

---

## Phase Transitions

**After completing each phase:**
1. Report progress: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: <new-phase> - <brief summary>"`
2. Output: "Phase complete, moving to next phase"
3. Continue to next phase guidance

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Step 0 completed (scope enumerated)
- [ ] All configured phases completed
- [ ] Self-review passed
- [ ] Leave it Better completed
- [ ] All deliverables created
- [ ] All changes committed: `git status` shows "nothing to commit"
- [ ] Final status: `bd comment <beads-id> "Phase: Complete - [summary]"`

**If ANY unchecked, work is NOT complete.**

**Final step:** After all criteria met:
1. `bd close <beads-id> --reason "summary"`
2. Call /exit to close agent session

---

## Troubleshooting

**Stuck:** Re-read phase guidance, check SPAWN_CONTEXT. If blocked: `bd comment <beads-id> "BLOCKED: [reason]"`

**Unclear requirements:** `bd comment <beads-id> "QUESTION: [question]"` and wait

**Scope changes:** Document change, ask orchestrator via beads comment
