TASK: verify daemon model selection works


SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "verify daemon model"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- orch complete must verify SYNTHESIS.md exists and is not placeholder before closing issue
  - Reason: 70% of agents completed without synthesis in 24h chaos period
- Orchestrator is AI, not Dylan - Dylan interacts with AI orchestrators who spawn/complete agents
  - Reason: Investigation 2025-12-25-design-orchestrator-completion-lifecycle-two incorrectly framed Dylan as the actor who spawns agents. The actor model is: Dylan ↔ AI Orchestrator ↔ Worker Agents. Mental model sync flows: Agent→Orchestrator (synthesis) and Orchestrator→Dylan (conversation).

### Prior Decisions
- orch spawn context delivery is reliable
  - Reason: Verified that SPAWN_CONTEXT.md is correctly populated and accessible by the agent
- Use build/orch for serve daemon
  - Reason: Prevents SIGKILL during make install
- Three-tier temporal model (ephemeral/persistent/operational) organizes artifact placement
  - Reason: Artifacts live where their lifecycle dictates - session-bound to workspace, project-lifetime to kb, work-in-progress to beads
- When spawned for cross-repo work, verify work completion status before starting
  - Reason: Task orch-go-oo1f: spawned in orch-go for work in orch-knowledge. Template was already retired (commit 7430185) before agent fully engaged. Quick verification could have saved agent context.
- Headless spawn mode is production-ready
  - Reason: All 5 requirements verified working: status detection, monitoring, completion detection, error handling, user visibility. Investigation orch-go-0r2q confirmed no blockers exist.
- CreateSession API now accepts model parameter for headless spawns
  - Reason: Headless mode was missing model selection capability - added Model field to CreateSessionRequest struct and threaded through CreateSession function to achieve parity with inline/tmux modes
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- OpenCode model selection is per-message, not per-session
  - Reason: Intentional design enabling mid-conversation model switching, cost optimization, and flexibility. Pass model to prompt/message calls, not session creation.
- Use CLI subprocess for headless spawns
  - Reason: OpenCode HTTP API ignores model parameter; CLI (opencode run --model) is the only way to specify models
- Layer 2 skill constraint verification already implemented in orch-go
  - Reason: pkg/verify/constraint.go (211 lines) parses SKILL-CONSTRAINTS block from SPAWN_CONTEXT.md and verifies required/optional patterns via VerifyCompletionFull()

### Models (synthesized understanding)
- Phase 4 Review: Model Pattern at N=11
  - See: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.kb/models/PHASE4_REVIEW.md
  - Summary:
    **At N=11, the model pattern shows exceptional consistency and proven utility.** All 11 models converged on the 6-section structure without enforcement. The enable/constrain query works across every domain tested. Most significantly: **the models that emerged reveal your cognitive investment priorities** - hot paths (spawn, agent, dashboard), strategic understanding (orchestrator, daemon), and owned complexity (completion, beads integration).
    
    **Key finding:** High investigation count + model existence = **friction that refused to resolve**. The absence of models for external dependencies (kb, tmux) despite high investigation counts reveals clear ownership boundaries.

  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-12.
    Changed files: pkg/daemon/daemon.go, pkg/daemon/skill_inference.go, pkg/daemon/completion_processing.go, pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go, cmd/orch/daemon.go.
    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    The daemon is an **autonomous agent spawner** that operates in a **poll-spawn-complete cycle**: polls beads for `triage:ready` issues, infers skill from issue type, spawns within capacity limits, monitors for `Phase: Complete`, verifies and closes. The daemon operates **independently of orchestrators** - orchestrators triage (label issues ready), daemon spawns (batch processing), orchestrators synthesize (review completed work). Skill inference uses **issue type** (not labels) to map task→investigation, bug→systematic-debugging, etc. Capacity management uses **WorkerPool** with reconciliation against OpenCode to free stale slots.
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### 1. Capacity Starvation
    
    **What happens:** Pool shows MaxAgents active, but `orch status` shows fewer actual agents running.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn failures don't release slots. Agent spawned, counted against pool, but spawn fails (bad skill name, missing context, etc.) - slot never released.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Pool only knows about attempts, not outcomes. No feedback loop from spawn failure to pool.
    
    **Fix:** Reconciliation with OpenCode. Query actual sessions, release slots for non-existent agents.
    
    **Prevention:** Spawn tracking with retry limits (`pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`).
    
    ### 2. Duplicate Spawns
    
    **What happens:** Same issue spawned multiple times by daemon on consecutive polls.
    
    **Root cause:** Spawn latency. Issue labeled `triage:ready` at poll N, daemon spawns, but spawn hasn't transitioned issue to `in_progress` by poll N+1. Daemon sees same issue still ready, spawns again.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Race condition between poll interval (60s) and spawn transition time (variable).
    
    **Fix:** Spawn deduplication via tracking. Track spawned beads IDs in memory, skip on subsequent polls until status confirms transition.
    
    **Source:** `pkg/daemon/spawn_tracker.go`
    
    ### 3. Skill Inference Mismatch
    
    **What happens:** Daemon spawns wrong skill for issue type.
    
    **Root cause:** Issue type doesn't match actual work needed. User creates `task` for implementation work (should be `feature`), daemon infers `investigation`.
    
    **Why detection is hard:** Type is set at creation, can't be changed by daemon. Daemon trusts type.
    
    **Fix:** Manual override. Orchestrator updates issue type before labeling `triage:ready`, or spawns manually with correct skill.
    
    **Prevention:** Better issue creation prompts, type validation, skill override via labels (future).

  - **STALENESS WARNING:**
    This model was last updated 2026-01-12.

    Verify model claims about these files against current code.
  - Summary:
    Anthropic restricts Opus 4.5 access via fingerprinting that blocks API usage but allows Claude Code CLI with Max subscription. This constraint forced a **dual spawn architecture**: primary path (OpenCode API + Sonnet/Flash, headless, high concurrency) and escape hatch (Claude CLI + Opus, tmux, crash-resistant). The escape hatch exists because critical infrastructure work (fixing the spawn system itself) can't depend on what might fail. Model choice now encodes reliability requirements, not just quality preferences.
    
    ---
  - Critical Invariants:
    1. **Never spawn OpenCode infrastructure work without --backend claude --tmux**
       - Violation: Agent kills itself mid-execution when server restarts
    
    2. **Infrastructure detection runs before model auto-selection**
       - Priority 2.5 (between explicit flags and model-based selection)
       - Ensures auto-apply happens even without explicit --backend
    
    3. **Opus only accessible via Claude CLI backend**
       - API requests to Opus fail with auth error
       - Fingerprinting checks more than headers (TLS, HTTP/2 frames, ordering)
    
    4. **Escape hatch provides true independence**
       - Claude CLI binary ≠ OpenCode server
       - Tmux session persists across service restarts
       - Different authentication path (Max subscription OAuth)
    
    ---
  - Why This Fails:
    ### Failure Mode 1: Zombie Agents (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Agents tracked in registry but never actually ran
    
    **Root Cause:** Spawning with `--model opus` before understanding auth gate
    - orch created registry entry
    - OpenCode session created
    - Anthropic rejected API request (fingerprinting)
    - Agent hung in "running" state
    - Consumed concurrency slot without doing work
    
    **Examples:**
    - orch-go-mo0ja, orch-go-pzi2i, orch-go-aoei0, orch-go-gd1gd, orch-go-lwc3o
    
    **Fix:** Never use `--model opus` without `--backend claude`
    
    ### Failure Mode 2: Header Injection Conflicts (Jan 8, 2026)
    
    **Symptom:** Gemini Flash spawns hung after attempting Opus bypass
    
    **Root Cause:** Injected Claude Code headers (`x-app: cli`, `anthropic-version`, etc.) into OpenCode's Anthropic provider
    - Bypassed Opus gate (didn't work)
    - Broke Gemini spawns (headers conflicted with Bun fetch/SDK)
    - System-wide impact from localized change
    
    **Lesson:** Fingerprinting is more sophisticated than headers alone
    
    ### Failure Mode 3: Infrastructure Work Kills Itself
    
    **Symptom:** Agent fixing OpenCode server crashes mid-execution
    
    **Root Cause:** Agent spawned via OpenCode API, agent's fix restarts OpenCode server, agent's session killed
    
    **Solution:** Infrastructure work detection auto-applies `--backend claude --tmux`
    
    **Why auto-detection matters:**
    - Humans forget to add flags manually
    - Task description might not mention "opencode" explicitly
    - Keyword scan catches common patterns
    - Escape hatch becomes invisible safety net

- orch clean to remove ghost sessions automatically

**IMPORTANT:** The above context represents existing knowledge and decisions. Do not contradict constraints. Reference models and guides for established patterns. Reference investigations for prior findings.






📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

⛔ **NEVER run `git push`** - Workers commit locally only.
   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.


1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session





CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Full criteria:** See `.kb/guides/decision-authority.md` for the complete decision tree and examples.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)

2. [Task-specific deliverables]


3. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-work-verify-daemon-model-18feb-d6af/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Track progress via beads comments. Call /exit to close agent session when done.




## SKILL GUIDANCE (hello)

**IMPORTANT:** You have been spawned WITH this skill context already loaded.
You do NOT need to invoke this skill using the Skill tool.

   - Your orchestrator will handle pushing to remote after review
   - Running `git push` can trigger deploys that disrupt production systems
   - Worker rule: Commit your work, call `/exit`. Don't push.



1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. `/exit`


⚠️ Your work is NOT complete until you run these commands.
