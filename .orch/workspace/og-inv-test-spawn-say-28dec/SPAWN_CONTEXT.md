TASK: Test spawn - say hello and immediately exit

SPAWN TIER: full

📚 FULL TIER: This spawn requires SYNTHESIS.md for knowledge externalization.
   Document your findings, decisions, and learnings in SYNTHESIS.md before completing.



## PRIOR KNOWLEDGE (from kb context)

**Query:** "test"

### Constraints (MUST respect)
- Agents must not spawn more than 3 iterations without human review
  - Reason: Prevents runaway iteration loops like 12 tmux fallback tests in 9 minutes
- External integrations require manual smoke test before Phase: Complete
  - Reason: OAuth feature shipped with passing tests but failed real-world use. Tests couldn't cover actual OAuth flow with Anthropic.
- Worker agents must test spawn functionality via unit tests and code review, not end-to-end spawning
  - Reason: Prevents recursive spawn testing incidents while still enabling verification
- Build artifacts should not be committed at project root
  - Reason: Development executables (orch-*, test-*) clutter the directory and waste space (~75MB+)
- Agents modifying web/ files MUST capture visual verification via Playwright MCP before completing
  - Reason: Tests passing does not verify UI renders correctly. Prior instances of UI features shipping with broken rendering despite passing tests.
- UI features require browser verification before marking complete
  - Reason: Post-mortem og-work-dashboard-two-modes-27dec: SSR hydration bug passed build/typecheck but failed in browser; agent documented 'not browser-tested' but had no gate to force validation
- UI features require browser verification before marking complete
  - Reason: Post-mortem og-work-dashboard-two-modes-27dec: SSR hydration bug passed build/typecheck but failed in browser; agent documented 'not browser-tested' but had no gate to force validation

### Prior Decisions
- Refactor shell-out functions for testability
  - Reason: Extracting command construction into Build*Command functions allows unit testing of logic without side effects
- VerifyCompletion relies on latest beads comment
  - Reason: Ensures current state is validated
- Temporal density and repeated constraints are highest value reflection signals
  - Reason: Low noise, high actionability - tested against real kn/kb data
- Constraint validity tested by implementation, not age
  - Reason: Constraints become outdated when code contradicts them (implementation supersession), not when time passes. Test with rg before assuming constraint holds.
- Confidence scores in investigations are noise, not signal
  - Reason: Nov 2025 Codex case: 5 investigations at High/Very High confidence all reached wrong conclusions. Current distribution: 90% cluster at 85-95%, providing no discriminative value. Recommendation: Replace with structured uncertainty (tested/untested enumeration).
- Tmux is the default spawn mode in orch-go, not headless
  - Reason: Testing and code inspection confirmed tmux is default (main.go:1042), CLAUDE.md documentation was incorrect
- Spawn system verified functional for basic use cases
  - Reason: Test spawn successfully created workspace, loaded context, created investigation file via kb CLI
- kb context uses keyword matching, not semantic understanding - 'how would the system recommend...' questions require orchestrator synthesis
  - Reason: Tested kb context with various query formats: keyword queries (swarm, dashboard) returned results, but semantic queries (swarm map sorting, how should dashboard present agents) returned nothing. The pattern reveals desire for semantic query answering that would require LLM-based RAG.
- UI changes in web/ require visual verification via Playwright MCP screenshot
  - Reason: Tests passing does not guarantee UI renders correctly. Visual evidence ensures feature works as intended.
- SHOULD-HOW-EXECUTE sequence for strategic questions
  - Reason: Epic orch-go-erdw was created from 'how do we' without testing premise. Architect found premise wrong. Wasted work avoided if 'should we' asked first.
- Use direct fetch in page.evaluate to test API performance
  - Reason: Bypasses SSE connection requirement while still testing the mock API response time
- Integration tests should use t.Skip when daemon not available
  - Reason: Allows tests to pass in CI or environments without beads daemon
- Use snap for simple visual verification, Playwright MCP for complex UI testing
  - Reason: Playwright MCP tool definitions cost ~5-10k tokens. For basic 'take screenshot' verification in feature-impl, snap CLI is sufficient and nearly zero token cost. Reserve Playwright for: automated assertions, headless CI, complex interactions.
- Auto-detect CLI commands feature was already complete
  - Reason: Found detectNewCLICommands at main.go:3082-3150 with tests passing - no additional work needed
- ActionEvent struct and action-log.jsonl persistence already implemented in pkg/action/
  - Reason: Prior agent orch-go-4oh7.1 completed this work. Verified 14 tests passing and integration with orch patterns command.

📋 AD-HOC SPAWN (--no-track):
This is an ad-hoc spawn without beads issue tracking.
Progress tracking via bd comment is NOT available.

🚨 SESSION COMPLETE PROTOCOL:
After your final commit, BEFORE typing anything else:

1. Ensure SYNTHESIS.md is created and committed in your workspace.
2. Run: `/exit` to close the agent session



CONTEXT: [See task description]

PROJECT_DIR: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go

SESSION SCOPE: Medium (estimated [1-2h / 2-4h / 4-6h+])
- Default estimation
- Recommend checkpoint after Phase 1 if session exceeds 2 hours


AUTHORITY:
**You have authority to decide:**
- Implementation details (how to structure code, naming, file organization)
- Testing strategies (which tests to write, test frameworks to use)
- Refactoring within scope (improving code quality without changing behavior)
- Tool/library selection within established patterns (using tools already in project)
- Documentation structure and wording

**You must escalate to orchestrator when:**
- Architectural decisions needed (changing system structure, adding new patterns)
- Scope boundaries unclear (unsure if something is IN vs OUT scope)
- Requirements ambiguous (multiple valid interpretations exist)
- Blocked by external dependencies (missing access, broken tools, unclear context)
- Major trade-offs discovered (performance vs maintainability, security vs usability)
- Task estimation significantly wrong (2h task is actually 8h)

**When uncertain:** Err on side of escalation. Document question in workspace, set Status: QUESTION, and wait for orchestrator response. Better to ask than guess wrong.

**Surface Before Circumvent:**
Before working around ANY constraint (technical, architectural, or process):
1. Document it in your investigation file: "CONSTRAINT: [what constraint] - [why considering workaround]"
2. Include the constraint and your reasoning in SYNTHESIS.md
3. The accountability is a feature, not a cost

This applies to:
- System constraints discovered during work (e.g., API limits, tool limitations)
- Architectural patterns that seem inconvenient for your task
- Process requirements that feel like overhead
- Prior decisions (from `kb context`) that conflict with your approach

**Why:** Working around constraints without surfacing them:
- Prevents the system from learning about recurring friction
- Bypasses stakeholders who should know about the limitation
- Creates hidden technical debt

DELIVERABLES (REQUIRED):
1. **FIRST:** Verify project location: pwd (must be /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go)
2. **SET UP investigation file:** Run `kb create investigation test-spawn-say-hello-immediately` to create from template
   - This creates: `.kb/investigations/simple/YYYY-MM-DD-test-spawn-say-hello-immediately.md`
   - This file is your coordination artifact (replaces WORKSPACE.md)
   - If command fails, report to orchestrator immediately

3. **UPDATE investigation file** as you work:
   - Add TLDR at top (1-2 sentence summary of question and finding)
   - Fill sections: What I tried → What I observed → Test performed
   - Only fill Conclusion if you actually tested (this is the key discipline)
4. Update Status: field when done (Active → Complete)
5. [Task-specific deliverables]

6. **CREATE SYNTHESIS.md:** Before completing, create `SYNTHESIS.md` in your workspace: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/workspace/og-inv-test-spawn-say-28dec/SYNTHESIS.md
   - Use the template from: /Users/dylanconlin/Documents/personal/orch-go/.orch/templates/SYNTHESIS.md
   - This is CRITICAL for the orchestrator to review your work.


STATUS UPDATES:
Update Status: field in your investigation file:
- Status: Active (while working)
- Status: Complete (when done and committed) → then call /exit to close agent session

Signal orchestrator when blocked:
- Add '**Status:** BLOCKED - [reason]' to investigation file
- Add '**Status:** QUESTION - [question]' when needing input

## Summary

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

# Investigation Skill

**Purpose:** Answer a question by testing, not by reasoning.

## The One Rule

**You cannot conclude without testing.**

If you didn't run a test, you don't get to fill the Conclusion section.

## Evidence Hierarchy

**Artifacts are claims, not evidence.**

| Source Type | Examples | Treatment |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Primary** (authoritative) | Actual code, test output, observed behavior | This IS the evidence |
| **Secondary** (claims to verify) | Workspaces, investigations, decisions | Hypotheses to test |

When an artifact says "X is not implemented," that's a hypothesis—not a finding to report. Search the codebase before concluding.

**The failure mode:** An agent reads a workspace claiming "feature X NOT DONE" and reports that as a finding without checking if feature X actually exists in the code.

## Workflow

1. Create investigation file: `kb create investigation {slug}`
2. Fill in your question
3. Try things, observe what happens
4. **Run a test to validate your hypothesis**
5. Fill conclusion only if you tested
6. Commit

## D.E.K.N. Summary

**Every investigation file starts with a D.E.K.N. summary block at the top.** This enables 30-second handoff to fresh Claude.

| Section | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Delta** | What was discovered/answered | "Test-running guidance is missing from spawn prompts" |
| **Evidence** | Primary evidence supporting conclusion | "Searched 5 agent sessions - none ran tests" |
| **Knowledge** | What was learned (insights, constraints) | "Agents follow documentation literally" |
| **Next** | Recommended action | "Add test-running instruction to template" |

**Fill D.E.K.N. at the END of your investigation, before marking Complete.**

## Template

The template enforces the discipline. Use `kb create investigation {slug}` to create.

```markdown
## Summary (D.E.K.N.)

**Delta:** [What was discovered/answered]
**Evidence:** [Primary evidence supporting conclusion]
**Knowledge:** [What was learned]
**Next:** [Recommended action]

---

# Investigation: [Topic]

**Question:** [What are you trying to figure out?]
**Status:** Active | Complete

## Findings
[Evidence gathered]

## Test performed
**Test:** [What you did to validate]
**Result:** [What happened]

## Conclusion
[Only fill if you tested]
```

## Common Failures

**"Logical verification" is not a test.**

Wrong:
```markdown
## Test performed
**Test:** Reviewed the code logic
**Result:** The implementation looks correct
```

Right:
```markdown
## Test performed
**Test:** Ran `time orch spawn investigation "test"` 5 times
**Result:** Average 6.2s, breakdown: 70ms orch overhead, 5.5s Claude startup
```

**Speculation is not a conclusion.**

Wrong:
```markdown
## Conclusion
Based on the code structure, the issue is likely X.
```

Right:
```markdown
## Conclusion
The test confirmed X is the cause. When I changed Y, the behavior changed to Z.
```

## When Not to Use

- **Fixing bugs** → Use `systematic-debugging`
- **Trivial questions** → Just answer them
- **Documentation** → Use `capture-knowledge`

## Self-Review (Mandatory)

Before completing, verify investigation quality:

### Scope Verification

**Did you scope the problem with rg before concluding?**

| Check | How | If Failed |
|-------|-----|-----------|
| **Problem scoped** | Ran `rg` to find all occurrences of the pattern being investigated | Run now, update findings |
| **Scope documented** | Investigation states "Found X occurrences in Y files" | Add concrete numbers |
| **Broader patterns checked** | Searched for variations/related patterns | Document what else exists |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Investigating "how does auth work?"
rg "authenticate|authorize|jwt|token" --type py -l  # Scope: which files touch auth

# Investigating "why does X fail?"
rg "error.*X|X.*error" --type py  # Find all error handling for X

# Investigating "where is config loaded?"
rg "config|settings|env" --type py -l  # Scope the config surface area
```

**Why this matters:** Investigations that don't scope the problem often miss the full picture. "I found one place that does X" is less useful than "X happens in 3 files: A, B, C."

---

### Investigation-Specific Checks

| Check | Verification | If Failed |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Real test performed** | Not "reviewed code" or "analyzed logic" | Go back and test |
| **Conclusion from evidence** | Based on test results, not speculation | Rewrite conclusion |
| **Question answered** | Original question has clear answer | Complete the investigation |
| **Reproducible** | Someone else could follow your steps | Add detail |

### Self-Review Checklist

- [ ] **Test is real** - Ran actual command/code, not just "reviewed"
- [ ] **Evidence concrete** - Specific outputs, not "it seems to work"
- [ ] **Conclusion factual** - Based on observed results, not inference
- [ ] **No speculation** - Removed "probably", "likely", "should" from conclusion
- [ ] **Question answered** - Investigation addresses the original question
- [ ] **File complete** - All sections filled (not "N/A" or "None")
- [ ] **D.E.K.N. filled** - Replaced placeholders in Summary section (Delta, Evidence, Knowledge, Next)
- [ ] **NOT DONE claims verified** - If claiming something is incomplete, searched actual files/code to confirm (not just artifact claims)

### Discovered Work Check

*During this investigation, did you discover any of the following?*

| Type | Examples | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Bugs** | Broken functionality, edge cases that fail | `bd create "description" --type bug` |
| **Technical debt** | Workarounds, code that needs refactoring | `bd create "description" --type task` |
| **Enhancement ideas** | Better approaches, missing features | `bd create "description" --type feature` |
| **Documentation gaps** | Missing/outdated docs | Note in completion summary |

*When creating issues for discovered work, apply triage labels:*

| Confidence | Label | When to use |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| High | `triage:ready` | Clear problem, known fix approach, well-scoped |
| Lower | `triage:review` | Uncertain scope, needs orchestrator input |

Example:
```bash
bd create "Bug: edge case in validation" --type bug
bd label <issue-id> triage:ready  # or triage:review
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] **Reviewed for discoveries** - Checked investigation for patterns, bugs, or ideas beyond original scope
- [ ] **Tracked if applicable** - Created beads issues for actionable items (or noted "No discoveries")
- [ ] **Included in summary** - Completion comment mentions discovered items (if any)

**If no discoveries:** Note "No discovered work items" in completion comment. This is common and acceptable.

**Why this matters:** Investigations often reveal issues beyond the original question. Beads issues ensure these discoveries surface in SessionStart context rather than getting buried in investigation files.

### Document in Investigation File

At the end of your investigation file, add:

```markdown
## Self-Review

- [ ] Real test performed (not code review)
- [ ] Conclusion from evidence (not speculation)
- [ ] Question answered
- [ ] File complete

**Self-Review Status:** PASSED / FAILED
