## Failure Summary

**Primary Cause:** %s

**Details:**
[Describe what went wrong - symptoms observed, errors encountered, or why the agent was stuck]

## Progress Made

### Completed Steps
- [ ] [Step 1 - if any]

### Partial Progress
- [What was started but not finished]

### Artifacts Created
- [List any files created before abandonment]

## Learnings

**What worked:**

**What didn't work:**
- [Approaches that failed or caused issues]

**Root cause analysis:**
- [If known, why did this fail? External dependency? Tool issue? Scope creep? Context exhaustion?]

## Recovery Recommendations

**Can this be retried?** yes

**If yes, what should be different:**
- [Suggestion 1 - different approach]
- [Suggestion 2 - smaller scope]
- [Suggestion 3 - additional context needed]

**If spawning a new agent:**

## TLDR

[1-2 sentence summary. What was the goal? What was achieved?]

---

## Delta (What Changed)

### Files Created
- ` + "`path/to/file.go`" + ` - Brief description

### Files Modified
- ` + "`path/to/existing.go`" + ` - What was changed

### Commits
- ` + "`abc1234`" + ` - Commit message summary

---

## Evidence (What Was Observed)

- Observation 1 with source reference (file:line or command output)
- Observation 2 with source reference
- Key finding that informed decisions

### Tests Run
` + "```bash" + `
# Command and result
go test ./...
# PASS: all tests passing
` + "```" + `

---

## Knowledge (What Was Learned)

### New Artifacts
- ` + "`.kb/investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`" + ` - Brief description

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: [choice] because [rationale]

### Constraints Discovered
- Constraint 1 - Why it matters

### Externalized via ` + "`kb quick`" + `
- ` + "`kb quick decide \"X\" --reason \"Y\"`" + ` - [if applicable]
- ` + "`kb quick constrain \"X\" --reason \"Y\"`" + ` - [if applicable]
- ` + "`kb quick tried \"X\" --failed \"Y\"`" + ` - [if applicable]

## Next (What Should Happen)

**Recommendation:** {close | spawn-follow-up | escalate | resume}

### If Close
- [ ] All deliverables complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Investigation file has ` + "`**Phase:** Complete`" + `
- [ ] Ready for ` + "`orch complete {issue-id}`" + `

### If Spawn Follow-up
**Issue:** {new-issue-title}
**Skill:** {recommended-skill}
**Context:**
` + "```" + `
{Brief context for next agent - 2-3 sentences max}
` + "```" + `

### If Escalate
**Question:** {what needs decision from orchestrator}
**Options:**
1. {option A} - pros/cons
2. {option B} - pros/cons

**Recommendation:** {which option and why}

### If Resume
**Next Step:** {what to do when resuming}
**Blocker:** {what prevented completion}
**Context to Reload:**
- {key file to re-read}
- {state to remember}
